Ching Chu SunPeter HendrixJianqiang MaRolf Harald Baayen,Behavior Research Methods,chinese lexical database cld,2018,"We present the Chinese Lexical Database (CLD): a large-scale lexical database for simplified Chinese. The CLD provides a wealth of lexical information for 3913 one-character words, 34,233 two-character words, 7143 three-character words, and 3355 four-character words, and is publicly available through http://www.chineselexicaldatabase.com. For each of the 48,644 words in the CLD, we provide a wide range of categorical predictors, as well as an extensive set of frequency measures, complexity measures, neighborhood density measures, orthography-phonology consistency measures, and information-theoretic measures. We evaluate the explanatory power of the lexical variables in the CLD in the context of experimental data through analyses of lexical decision latencies for one-character, two-character, three-character and four-character words, as well as word naming latencies for one-character and two-character words. The results of these analyses are discussed."
Brendan T. JohnsRandall K. Jamieson,Behavior Research Methods,the influence of place and time on lexical behavior a distributional analysis,2019,"We measured and documented the influence of corpus effects on lexical behavior. Specifically, we used a corpus of over 26,000 fiction books to show that computational models of language trained on samples of language (i.e., subcorpora) representative of the language located in a particular place and time can track differences in people’s experimental language behavior. This conclusion was true across multiple tasks (lexical decision, category production, and word familiarity) and provided insight into the influence that language experience imposes on language processing and organization. We used the assembled corpus and methods to validate a new machine-learning approach for optimizing language models, entitled experiential optimization (Johns, Jones, & Mewhort in Psychonomic Bulletin & Review, 26, 103–126, 2019)."
Christina L. GagnéThomas L. SpaldingDaniel Schmidtke,Behavior Research Methods,ladec the large database of english compounds,2019,"The Large Database of English Compounds (LADEC) consists of over 8,000 English words that can be parsed into two constituents that are free morphemes, making it the largest existing database specifically for use in research on compound words. Both monomorphemic (e.g., wheel) and multimorphemic (e.g., teacher) constituents were used. The items were selected from a range of sources, including CELEX, the English Lexicon Project, the British Lexicon Project, the British National Corpus, and Wordnet, and were hand-coded as compounds (e.g., snowball). Participants rated each compound in terms of how predictable its meaning is from its parts, as well as the extent to which each constituent retains its meaning in the compound. In addition, we obtained linguistic characteristics that might influence compound processing (e.g., frequency, family size, and bigram frequency). To show the usefulness of the database in investigating compound processing, we conducted a number of analyses that showed that compound processing is consistently affected by semantic transparency, as well as by many of the other variables included in LADEC. We also showed that the effects of the variables associated with the two constituents are not symmetric. In short, LADEC provides the opportunity for researchers to investigate a number of questions about compounds that have not been possible to investigate in the past, due to the lack of sufficiently large and robust datasets. In addition to directly allowing researchers to test hypotheses using the information included in LADEC, the database will contribute to future compound research by allowing better stimulus selection and matching."
Steven VerheyenSimon De DeyneSarah LinsenGert Storms,Behavior Research Methods,lexicosemantic affective and distributional norms for 1000 dutch adjectives,2019,"The research of the word is still very much the research of the noun. Adjectives have been largely overlooked, despite being the second-largest word class in many languages and serving an important communicative function, because of the rich, nuanced qualifications they afford. Adjectives are also ideally suited to study the interface between cognition and emotion, as they naturally cover the entire range of lexicosemantic variables such as imageability (infinite–green), and affective variables such as valence (sad–happy). We illustrate this by showing how the centrality of words in the mental lexicon varies as a function of the words’ affective dimensions, using newly collected norms for 1,000 Dutch adjectives. The norms include the lexicosemantic variables age of acquisition, familiarity, concreteness, and imageability; the affective variables valence, arousal, and dominance; and a variety of distributional variables, including network statistics resulting from a large-scale word association study. The norms are freely available from https://osf.io/nyg8v/, for researchers studying adjectives specifically or for whom adjectives constitute convenient stimuli to study other topics, such as vagueness, inference, spatial cognition, or affective word processing."
Shu-Yen LinHsueh-Chih ChenTao-Hsing ChangWei-En LeeYao-Ting Sung,Behavior Research Methods,clad a corpus derived chinese lexical association database,2019,"The application of word associations has become increasingly widespread. However, the association norms produced by traditional free association tests tend not to exceed 10,000 stimulus words, making the number of associated words too small to be representative of the overall language. In this study we used text corpora totaling over 400 million Chinese words, along with a multitude of association measures, to automatically construct a Chinese Lexical Association Database (CLAD) comprising the lexical association of over 80,000 words. Comparison of the CLAD with a database of traditional Chinese word association norms shows that word associations extracted from large text corpora are similar in strength to those elicited from free association tests but contain a much greater number of associative word pairs. Additionally, the relatively small numbers of participants involved in the creation of traditional norms result in relatively coarse scales of association measurement, whereas the differentiation of association strengths is greatly enhanced in the CLAD. The CLAD provides researchers with a great supplement to traditional word association norms. A query website at www.chinesereadability.net/LexicalAssociation/CLAD/ affords access to the database."
Mathias SchmitzMarine RougierVincent Yzerbyt,Behavior Research Methods,comment on quantifying the informational value of classification images a miscomputation of the infoval metric,2019,"Brinkman et al. (2019) recently introduced an innovative metric—infoVal—to assess the informational value of classification images (CIs) relative to a random distribution. Although this measure constitutes a valuable tool to distinguish random from nonrandom CIs, we identified two noteworthy discrepancies between the mathematical formalization of the infoVal metric and the authors’ computation. Specifically, the computation was based on the one norm instead of the Euclidean norm, and the k constant was omitted in the denominator of the ratio that produces infoVal. Accordingly, the simulations and experimental results reported by Brinkman et al. do not build on the correct infoVal computation but on a biased index. Importantly, this discrepancy in the computation affects the statistical power and Type I and error rate of the metric. Here we clarify the nature of the discrepancies in the computation and run Brinkman et al.’s Simulation 1 anew with the correct values, to illustrate their consequences. Overall, we found that relying on the miscomputed infoVal metric can lead to misguided conclusions, and we urge researchers to use the correct values."
Carmen DasíMaría José SolerJuan Carlos Ruiz,Behavior Research Methods,priming index of the spanish word fragments from the das soler and ruiz 2004 database,2007,"Word-fragment completion is a frequently used test in implicit memory research. A database of 196 Spanish fragments was recently published (Dasí, Soler, & Ruiz, 2004) in which the fragments were described for indices, such as difficulty, familiarity, frequency, number of meanings, and so on (www.psychonomic.org/archive). In this work, a new index, thepriming index, is described for the same 196 fragments. This index is calculated for each fragment by subtracting the difficulty index (the proportion of correct completion when the fragment is not studied) from the proportion of correct completion when the fragment is studied, and it means the capacity of an item to be primed. In order to determine whether the new index performs well, we have replicated some important experimental effects, such as priming, frequency, and difficulty. We consider that this index can help researchers to better select stimuli for fragment-completion tasks."
John TawaRosalyn NegrónJürgen Pfeffer,Behavior Research Methods,the measurement of interpersonal interactions with continuous spatiotemporal data application to a study of the effects of resource competition on racial group interactions,2019,"We describe a sequential qualitative ➔ quantitative mixed-method procedure used to construct conceptually grounded quantitative metrics of interpersonal behavior from continuous spatiotemporal data. Metrics were developed from data collected during an experiment in which racially diverse participants interacted with self-resembling avatars at social events hosted in the virtual world Second Life. In the qualitative stage, the researchers conceptualized four distinct patterns of movement from overhead video recreations of participants interacting during the social events. In the quantitative stage, these patterns of movement were operationalized into metrics to reflect each type of observed interpersonal behavior. The metrics were normalized through a series of transformations, and construct validity was assessed through correlations with self-report measures of intergroup behavior. Finally, the metrics were applied to an analysis of the virtual-world study examining the influence of resource competition on racial group interactions. The findings contribute to our understanding of the influence of resource competition on Blacks’, Asians’, and Whites’ group dynamics. Applications of these metrics for the future of the psychological study of interpersonal behavior are discussed."
Christopher R. WolfeMitchell DandignacValerie F. Reyna,Behavior Research Methods,a theoretically motivated method for automatically evaluating texts for gist inferences,2019,"We developed a method to automatically assess texts for features that help readers produce gist inferences. Following fuzzy-trace theory, we used a procedure in which participants recalled events under gist or verbatim instructions. Applying Coh-Metrix, we analyzed written responses in order to create gist inference scores (GISs), or seven variables converted to Z scores and averaged, which assess the potential for readers to form gist inferences from observable text characteristics. Coh-Metrix measures reflect referential cohesion and deep cohesion, which increase GIS because they facilitate coherent mental representations. Conversely, word concreteness, hypernymy for nouns and verbs (specificity), and imageability decrease GIS, because they promote verbatim representations. Also, the difference between abstract verb overlap among sentences (using latent semantic analysis) and more concrete verb overlap (using WordNet) should enhance coherent gist inferences, rather than verbatim memory for specific verbs. In the first study, gist condition responses scored nearly two standard deviations higher on GIS than did the verbatim condition responses. Predictions based on GIS were confirmed in two text analysis studies of 50 scientific journal article texts and 50 news articles and editorials. Texts from the Discussion sections of psychology journal articles scored significantly higher on GIS than did texts from the Method sections of the same journal articles. News reports also scored significantly lower than editorials on the same topics from the same news outlets. GIS proved better at discriminating among texts than did alternative formulae. In a behavioral experiment with closely matched text pairs, people randomly assigned to high-GIS versions scored significantly higher on knowledge and comprehension."
Jesse ChandlerCheskie RosenzweigAaron J. MossJonathan RobinsonLeib Litman,Behavior Research Methods,online panels in social science research expanding sampling methods beyond mechanical turk,2019,"Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) is widely used by behavioral scientists to recruit research participants. MTurk offers advantages over traditional student subject pools, but it also has important limitations. In particular, the MTurk population is small and potentially overused, and some groups of interest to behavioral scientists are underrepresented and difficult to recruit. Here we examined whether online research panels can avoid these limitations. Specifically, we compared sample composition, data quality (measured by effect sizes, internal reliability, and attention checks), and the non-naivete of participants recruited from MTurk and Prime Panels—an aggregate of online research panels. Prime Panels participants were more diverse in age, family composition, religiosity, education, and political attitudes. Prime Panels participants also reported less exposure to classic protocols and produced larger effect sizes, but only after screening out several participants who failed a screening task. We conclude that online research panels offer a unique opportunity for research, yet one with some important trade-offs."
Max M. KrasnowRhea M. HowardAdar B. Eisenbruch,Behavior Research Methods,the importance of being honest evidence that deception may not pollute social science subject pools after all,2019,"Deceiving participants about the goals or content of a study is permitted in psychological research but is largely banned in economics journals and subject pools. This ban is intended to protect a public good: If experiencing deception causes participants to be suspicious in future studies, and suspicion meaningfully influences their behavior, then the entire field suffers. We report a survey of psychologists’ and economists’ attitudes toward deception (N = 568) and a large, nondeceptive multisite study in which we measured participants’ histories, suspicion levels, and behavior in four common economic tasks (N = 636). Economists reported more negative attitudes toward deceptive methods and greater support for the deception ban than did psychologists. The results of the behavioral study, however, do not support the “public good” argument for banning deception about the goals or content of a research study: Participants’ present suspicion was not clearly related to past experiences of deception, and there were no consistent behavioral differences between suspicious and credulous participants. We discuss the implications of these results for the ongoing debate regarding the acceptability of deceptive research methods."
Romi ZäskeVerena Gabriele SkukJessika GolleStefan R. Schweinberger,Behavior Research Methods,the jena speaker set jessa database of voice stimuli from unfamiliar young and old adult speakers,2019,"Here we describe the Jena Speaker Set (JESS), a free database for unfamiliar adult voice stimuli, comprising voices from 61 young (18–25 years) and 59 old (60–81 years) female and male speakers uttering various sentences, syllables, read text, semi-spontaneous speech, and vowels. Listeners rated two voice samples (short sentences) per speaker for attractiveness, likeability, two measures of distinctiveness (“deviation”-based [DEV] and “voice in the crowd”-based [VITC]), regional accent, and age. Interrater reliability was high, with Cronbach’s α between .82 and .99. Young voices were generally rated as more attractive than old voices, but particularly so when male listeners judged female voices. Moreover, young female voices were rated as more likeable than both young male and old female voices. Young voices were judged to be less distinctive than old voices according to the DEV measure, with no differences in the VITC measure. In age ratings, listeners almost perfectly discriminated young from old voices; additionally, young female voices were perceived as being younger than young male voices. Correlations between the rating dimensions above demonstrated (among other things) that DEV-based distinctiveness was strongly negatively correlated with rated attractiveness and likeability. By contrast, VITC-based distinctiveness was uncorrelated with rated attractiveness and likeability in young voices, although a moderate negative correlation was observed for old voices. Overall, the present results demonstrate systematic effects of vocal age and gender on impressions based on the voice and inform as to the selection of suitable voice stimuli for further research into voice perception, learning, and memory."
Paweł ManderaEmmanuel KeuleersMarc Brysbaert,Behavior Research Methods,recognition times for 62 thousand english words data from the english crowdsourcing project,2019,"We present a new dataset of English word recognition times for a total of 62 thousand words, called the English Crowdsourcing Project. The data were collected via an internet vocabulary test in which more than one million people participated. The present dataset is limited to native English speakers. Participants were asked to indicate which words they knew. Their response times were registered, although at no point were the participants asked to respond as quickly as possible. Still, the response times correlate around .75 with the response times of the English Lexicon Project for the shared words. Also, the results of virtual experiments indicate that the new response times are a valid addition to the English Lexicon Project. This not only means that we have useful response times for some 35 thousand extra words, but we now also have data on differences in response latencies as a function of education and age."

We present a longitudinal corpus of texts on short picture stories written by German primary school children between grades 2 and 4 and grades 3 and 4. It includes 1,922 texts with 212,505 tokens (6,364 types) from 251 children. For each text, rich metadata is available, including age, grade and linguistic background (at least 60% of the children were multilingual). To our knowledge, our corpus is the largest longitudinal corpus of written texts by children at primary school age. Each word is included in its original spelling as well as in a normalized form (target hypothesis), specifying the intended word form, which we corrected for orthographic but not grammatical errors. Original and target word forms are aligned character-wise and the target word forms are enriched with phonological, syllabic, and morphological information. Additionally, for each target word form, we established key lexical variables, e.g., word frequency or summed bigram frequency, as specified in childLex. Where applicable, we also specify key features of German orthography (e.g., consonant doubling, vowel-lengthening <h>). Taken together, this information allows for a detailed assessment of the properties of words that tend to increase the likelihood of spelling errors. The corpus is available in different formats—as tab-delimited annotated token and type based lists, in an XML format, and via the corpus search tool ANNIS."
Yi-Shin LinAndrew HeathcoteWilliam R. Holmes,Behavior Research Methods,parallel probability density approximation,2019,"Probability density approximation (PDA) is a nonparametric method of calculating probability densities. When integrated into Bayesian estimation, it allows researchers to fit psychological processes for which analytic probability functions are unavailable, significantly expanding the scope of theories that can be quantitatively tested. PDA is, however, computationally intensive, requiring large numbers of Monte Carlo simulations in order to attain good precision. We introduce Parallel PDA (pPDA), a highly efficient implementation of this method utilizing the Armadillo C++ and CUDA C libraries to conduct millions of model simulations simultaneously in graphics processing units (GPUs). This approach provides a practical solution for rapidly approximating probability densities with high precision. In addition to demonstrating this method, we fit a piecewise linear ballistic accumulator model (Holmes, Trueblood, & Heathcote, 2016) to empirical data. Finally, we conducted simulation studies to investigate various issues associated with PDA and provide guidelines for pPDA applications to other complex cognitive models."
Isabelle DarcyNathalie M. G. Fontaine,Behavior Research Methods,the hoosier vocal emotions corpus a validated set of north american english pseudo words for evaluating emotion processing,2019,"This article presents the development of the “Hoosier Vocal Emotions Corpus,” a stimulus set of recorded pseudo-words based on the pronunciation rules of English. The corpus contains 73 controlled audio pseudo-words uttered by two actresses in five different emotions (i.e., happiness, sadness, fear, anger, and disgust) and in a neutral tone, yielding 1,763 audio files. In this article, we describe the corpus as well as a validation study of the pseudo-words. A total of 96 native English speakers completed a forced choice emotion identification task. All emotions were recognized better than chance overall, with substantial variability among the different tokens. All of the recordings, including the ambiguous stimuli, are made freely available, and the recognition rates and the full confusion matrices for each stimulus are provided in order to assist researchers and clinicians in the selection of stimuli. The corpus has unique characteristics that can be useful for experimental paradigms that require controlled stimuli (e.g., electroencephalographic or fMRI studies). Stimuli from this corpus could be used by researchers and clinicians to answer a variety of questions, including investigations of emotion processing in individuals with certain temperamental or behavioral characteristics associated with difficulties in emotion recognition (e.g., individuals with psychopathic traits); in bilingual individuals or nonnative English speakers; in patients with aphasia, schizophrenia, or other mental health disorders (e.g., depression); or in training automatic emotion recognition algorithms. The Hoosier Vocal Emotions Corpus is available at https://psycholinguistics.indiana.edu/hoosiervocalemotions.htm."
Federica BulgarelliElika Bergelson,Behavior Research Methods,look whos talking a comparison of automated and human generated speaker tags in naturalistic day long recordings,2019,"The LENA system has revolutionized research on language acquisition, providing both a wearable device to collect day-long recordings of children’s environments, and a set of automated outputs that process, identify, and classify speech using proprietary algorithms. This output includes information about input sources (e.g., adult male, electronics). While this system has been tested across a variety of settings, here we delve deeper into validating the accuracy and reliability of LENA’s automated diarization, i.e., tags of who is talking. Specifically, we compare LENA’s output with a gold standard set of manually generated talker tags from a dataset of 88 day-long recordings, taken from 44 infants at 6 and 7 months, which includes 57,983 utterances. We compare accuracy across a range of classifications from the original Lena Technical Report, alongside a set of analyses examining classification accuracy by utterance type (e.g., declarative, singing). Consistent with previous validations, we find overall high agreement between the human and LENA-generated speaker tags for adult speech in particular, with poorer performance identifying child, overlap, noise, and electronic speech (accuracy range across all measures: 0–92%). We discuss several clear benefits of using this automated system alongside potential caveats based on the error patterns we observe, concluding with implications for research using LENA-generated speaker tags."
Hugo MailhotMaximiliano A. WilsonJoël MacoirS. Hélène DeaconClaudia Sánchez-Gutiérrez,Behavior Research Methods,morpholex fr a derivational morphological database for 38840 french words,2019,"Studies on morphological processing in French, as in other languages, have shown disparate results. We argue that a critical and long-overlooked factor that could underlie these diverging results is the methodological differences in the calculation of morphological variables across studies. To address the need for a common morphological database, we present MorphoLex-FR, a sizeable and freely available database with 12 variables for prefixes, roots, and suffixes for the 38,840 words of the French Lexicon Project. MorphoLex-FR constitutes a first step to render future studies addressing morphological processing in French comparable. The procedure we used for morphological segmentation and variable computation is effectively the same as that in MorphoLex, an English morphological database. This will allow for cross-linguistic comparisons of future studies in French and English that will contribute to our understanding of how morphologically complex words are processed. To validate these variables, we explored their influence on lexical decision latencies for morphologically complex nouns in a series of hierarchical regression models. The results indicated that only morphological variables related to the suffix explained lexical decision latencies. The frequency and family size of the suffix exerted facilitatory effects, whereas the percentage of more frequent words in the morphological family of the suffix was inhibitory. Our results are in line with previous studies conducted in French and in English. In conclusion, this database represents a valuable resource for studies on the effect of morphology in visual word processing in French."
Wim PouwJames P. TrujilloJames A. Dixon,Behavior Research Methods,the quantification of gesturespeech synchrony a tutorial and validation of multimodal data acquisition using device based and video based motion tracking,2019,"There is increasing evidence that hand gestures and speech synchronize their activity on multiple dimensions and timescales. For example, gesture’s kinematic peaks (e.g., maximum speed) are coupled with prosodic markers in speech. Such coupling operates on very short timescales at the level of syllables (200 ms), and therefore requires high-resolution measurement of gesture kinematics and speech acoustics. High-resolution speech analysis is common for gesture studies, given that field’s classic ties with (psycho)linguistics. However, the field has lagged behind in the objective study of gesture kinematics (e.g., as compared to research on instrumental action). Often kinematic peaks in gesture are measured by eye, where a “moment of maximum effort” is determined by several raters. In the present article, we provide a tutorial on more efficient methods to quantify the temporal properties of gesture kinematics, in which we focus on common challenges and possible solutions that come with the complexities of studying multimodal language. We further introduce and compare, using an actual gesture dataset (392 gesture events), the performance of two video-based motion-tracking methods (deep learning vs. pixel change) against a high-performance wired motion-tracking system (Polhemus Liberty). We show that the videography methods perform well in the temporal estimation of kinematic peaks, and thus provide a cheap alternative to expensive motion-tracking systems. We hope that the present article incites gesture researchers to embark on the widespread objective study of gesture kinematics and their relation to speech."

Harald Baayen,Language Resources and Evaluation,constructing two vietnamese corpora and building a lexical database,2019,"Corpus-based research has formed the backbone of linguistic research in recent decades. Large text corpora are used for solving various kinds of linguistic problems, including those of quantitative linguistics, cognitive linguistics, and psycholinguistics. This paper reports the creation of two corpora of contemporary Vietnamese. It also describes the construction of these two equally sized Vietnamese corpora (a corpus from Vietnamese film subtitles, subtlex-viet, and a general corpus of varieties of online newspapers and stories, genlex-viet). We document the general steps of the construction and extraction of linguistic information from the language corpora and provide a road map for others who would like to create similar corpora. The resultant corpora are available in three versions: plain text, tokenized, and POS tagged. In the second half of the paper, the construction of a lexical database derived from the corpora is described. The database includes measures such as frequency of occurrence, dispersion, Mutual Information, Inverse Document Frequency, as well as vector space measures based on Latent Semantic Analysis and Hyperspace Analogue to Language. We conclude by reporting a comparison of the lexical predictors and a validation using psycholinguistic data from visual lexical decision experiments."
Christiane Fellbaum,Computers and the Humanities,a semantic network of english the mother of all wordnets,1998,"We give a brief outline of the design and contents of the English lexical database WordNet, which serves as a model for similarly conceived wordnets in several European languages. WordNet is a semantic network, in which the meanings of nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs are represented in terms of their links to other (groups of) words via conceptual-semantic and lexical relations. Each part of speech is treated differently reflecting different semantic properties. We briefly discuss polysemy in WordNet, and focus on the case of meaning extensions in the verb lexicon. Finally, we outline the potential uses of WordNet not only for applications in natural language processing, but also for research in stylistic analyses in conjunction with a semantic concordance."
Harry M. Logan,Computers and the Humanities,electronic lexicography,1991,"This paper offers a brief survey of some important developments in the use of computers in making dictionaries and lexicons. Making a dictionary involves collecting the data, sorting and lemmatizing, editing and printing. Five major types of machine-readable dictionaries have developed from these procedures: Machine Readable Lexicons of individual authors, Machine Readable Dictionaries with codes for linguistic information, Machine Dictionaries with selected information, and Lexical Databases with lexical information abstracted from machine-readable dictionaries. The second edition of the QED is a machine-readable dictionary with codes that may provide the basis for a diachronic lexical database."

In EuroWordNet we have chosen for a flexible design in which local wordnets are built relatively independently as language-specific structures, which are linked to an Inter-Lingual-Index (ILI). To ensure compatibility between the wordnets, a core set of common concepts has been defined that has to be covered by every language. Furthermore, these concepts have been classified via the ILI in terms of a Top Ontology of 63 fundamental semantic distinctions used in various semantic theories and paradigms. This paper first discusses the process leading to the definition of the set of Base Concepts, and the structure and the rationale of the Top Ontology."

Muhidin MohamedMourad Oussalah,Language Resources and Evaluation,a hybrid approach for paraphrase identification based on knowledge enriched semantic heuristics,2019,"In this paper, we propose a hybrid approach for sentence paraphrase identification. The proposal addresses the problem of evaluating sentence-to-sentence semantic similarity when the sentences contain a set of named-entities. The essence of the proposal is to distinguish the computation of the semantic similarity of named-entity tokens from the rest of the sentence text. More specifically, this is based on the integration of word semantic similarity derived from WordNet taxonomic relations, and named-entity semantic relatedness inferred from Wikipedia entity co-occurrences and underpinned by Normalized Google Distance. In addition, the WordNet similarity measure is enriched with word part-of-speech (PoS) conversion aided with a Categorial Variation database (CatVar), which enhances the lexico-semantics of words. We validated our hybrid approach using two different datasets; Microsoft Research Paraphrase Corpus (MSRPC) and TREC-9 Question Variants. In our empirical evaluation, we showed that our system outperforms baselines and most of the related state-of-the-art systems for paraphrase detection. We also conducted a misidentification analysis to disclose the primary sources of our system errors.

EuroWordNet is an EC project that develops a multilingual database with wordnets in several European languages, structured along the same lines as the Princeton WordNet. Each wordnet represents an autonomous structure of language-specific lexicalizations, which are interconnected via an Inter-Lingual-Index. The wordnets are built at different sites from existing resources, starting from a shared level of basic concepts and extended top-down. The results will be publicly available and will be tested in cross-language information retrieval applications."

The most important reasons for such changes are the multilinguality of the EuroWordNet database and the fact that it is intended to be used in Language Engineering applications. Thus, i) some relations have been added to those identified in WordNet; ii) some labels have been identified which can be added to the relations in order to make their implications more explicit and precise; iii) some relations, already present in the WordNet design, have been modified in order to specify their role more clearly."
Alexis Amid NemeSébastien Paumier,Language Resources and Evaluation,restoring arabic vowels through omission tolerant dictionary lookup,2019,"Vowels in Arabic are optional orthographic symbols written as diacritics above or below letters. In Arabic texts, typically more than 97 percent of written words do not explicitly show any of the vowels they contain; that is to say, depending on the author, genre and field, less than 3 percent of words include any explicit vowel. Although numerous studies have been published on the issue of restoring the omitted vowels in speech technologies, little attention has been given to this problem in papers dedicated to written Arabic technologies. In this research, we present Arabic-Unitex, an Arabic Language Resource, with emphasis on vowel representation and encoding. Specifically, we present two dozens of rules formalizing a detailed description of vowel omission in written text. They are typographical rules integrated into large-coverage resources for morphological annotation. For restoring vowels, our resources are capable of identifying words in which the vowels are not shown, as well as words in which the vowels are partially or fully included. By taking into account these rules, our resources are able to compute and restore for each word form a list of compatible fully vowelized candidates through omission-tolerant dictionary lookup. In our previous studies, we have proposed a straightforward encoding of taxonomy for verbs (Neme in Proceedings of the international workshop on lexical resources (WoLeR) at ESSLLI, 2011) and broken plurals (Neme and Laporte in Lang Sci, 2013, http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.langsci.2013.06.002). While traditional morphology is based on derivational rules, our description is based on inflectional ones. The breakthrough lies in the reversal of the traditional root-and-pattern Semitic model into pattern-and-root, giving precedence to patterns over roots. The lexicon is built and updated manually and contains 76,000 fully vowelized lemmas. It is then inflected by means of finite-state transducers (FSTs), generating 6 million forms. The coverage of these inflected forms is extended by formalized grammars, which accurately describe agglutinations around a core verb, noun, adjective or preposition. A laptop needs one minute to generate the 6 million inflected forms in a 340-MB flat file, which is compressed in 2 min into 11 MB for fast retrieval. Our program performs the analysis of 5000 words/second for running text (20 pages/second). Based on these comprehensive linguistic resources, we created a spell checker that detects any invalid/misplaced vowel in a fully or partially vowelized form. Finally, our resources provide a lexical coverage of more than 99 percent of the words used in popular newspapers, and restore vowels in words (out of context) simply and efficiently."

OIL (Ontology Inference Layer) aims at implementing the ``semantic'' Web idea and is based on the notion of ontology, which is also employed in EuroWordNet and SIMPLE. In both latter projects the meanings of words are partially described by means of the finite sets of relations to other meanings of words, whereas in OIL the user is free to define the arbitrary relations of this kind.The relations considered in EuroWordNet and SIMPLE were defined on the basis of a careful observation of the large linguistic area, andt hey aim at reflecting the meaning as precisely as possible, therefore it seems useful to merge them with OIL. Moreover, the valuable feature of OIL is its formal language with precisely defined semantics.

Gerard de MeloGerhard Weikum,Language Resources and Evaluation,constructing and utilizing wordnets using statistical methods,2012,"Lexical databases following the wordnet paradigm capture information about words, word senses, and their relationships. A large number of existing tools and datasets are based on the original WordNet, so extending the landscape of resources aligned with WordNet leads to great potential for interoperability and to substantial synergies. Wordnets are being compiled for a considerable number of languages, however most have yet to reach a comparable level of coverage. We propose a method for automatically producing such resources for new languages based on WordNet, and analyse the implications of this approach both from a linguistic perspective as well as by considering natural language processing tasks. Our approach takes advantage of the original WordNet in conjunction with translation dictionaries. A small set of training associations is used to learn a statistical model for predicting associations between terms and senses. The associations are represented using a variety of scores that take into account structural properties as well as semantic relatedness and corpus frequency information. Although the resulting wordnets are imperfect in terms of their quality and coverage of language-specific phenomena, we show that they constitute a cheap and suitable alternative for many applications, both for monolingual tasks as well as for cross-lingual interoperability. Apart from analysing the resources directly, we conducted tests on semantic relatedness assessment and cross-lingual text classification with very promising results."

Christiane FellbaumPiek Vossen,Language Resources and Evaluation,challenges for a multilingual wordnet,2012,"Wordnets have been created in many languages, revealing both their lexical commonalities and diversity. The next challenge is to make multilingual wordnets fully interoperable. The EuroWordNet experience revealed the shortcomings of an interlingua based on a natural language. Instead, we propose a model based on the division of the lexicon and a language-independent, formal ontology that serves as the hub interlinking the language-specific lexicons. The ontology avoids the idiosyncracies of the lexicon and furthermore allows formal reasoning about the concepts it contains. We address the division of labor between ontology and lexicon. Finally, we illustrate our model in the context of a domain-specific multilingual information system based on a central ontology and interconnected wordnets in seven languages."

This system is built on previous work on automatic extraction of hyponymy links through shallow parsing. Second, we show how hypernym links between single-word terms can be extended to semantic links between multi-word terms through corpus-based extraction of semantic variants. The induced hierarchy is incomplete but provides an automatic generalization of single-word terms relations to multi-word terms that are pervasive in technical thesauri and corpora."

More than 10,000 of them were manually annotated as negative, neutral or positive. All corpora are publicly available under a Creative Commons copyright license. We used the annotated documents to construct a Slovene sentiment lexicon, which is the first of its kind for Slovene, and to assess the sentiment classification approaches used. The constructed corpora were also utilised to monitor within-the-document sentiment dynamics, its changes over time and relations with news topics. We show that sentiment is, on average, more explicit at the beginning of documents, and it loses sharpness towards the end of documents."

The fact that all necessary linguistic resources have to be built from scratch by each research team is a real obstacle to the development of Vietnamese language processing. The aim of our projects is thus to build a common linguistic database that is freely and easily exploitable for the automatic processing of Vietnamese. In this paper, we present our work on creating a Vietnamese lexicon for NLP applications. We emphasize the standardization aspect of the lexicon representation. We especially propose an extensible set of Vietnamese syntactic descriptions that can be used for tagset definition and morphosyntactic analysis.

We highlight various aspects such as the data quantity needed for training and the influence of data quality on tagger performance. Since the lack of annotated resources poses a problem for training a tagger, we exemplify how existing resources can be adapted fruitfully to serve as additional training data. The resulting POS model achieves a tagging accuracy of about 91% on a diverse test set representing the different genres, time periods and varieties of MHG. In order to verify its general applicability, we evaluate the performance on different genres, authors and varieties of MHG, separately. We explore self-learning techniques which yield the advantage that unannotated data can be utilized to improve tagging performance on specific subcorpora.

To deal with the problem, we first make use of a kind of supervised learning technique to learn a set of defining formats for each class in the thesaurus, which tries to characterize the regularities about the definitions of the words in the class. We then use traditional techniques in Graph theory to derive a minimal subset of the new words to be added into the thesaurus, which meets the following condition: if we add the new words in the subset into the thesaurus by hand, the other new words can be added into the thesaurus automatically by matching their definitions with the defining formats of each class in the thesaurus. The method uses little, if any, language-specific or thesaurus-specific knowledge, and can be applied to the thesauri of other languages."

They imply that texts by one author show more similarities in language use than texts between authors. Sociolects, on the other hand, are group-dependent similarities in language use. They imply that texts by a group of authors, for instance in terms of gender or time period, share more similarities within a group than between groups. Although idiolects and sociolects are commonly used terms in the humanities, they have not been investigated a great deal from corpus and computational linguistic points of view. To test several idiolect and sociolect hypotheses a factorial combination was used of time period (Modernism, Realism), gender of author (male, female) and author (Eliot, Dickens, Woolf, Joyce) totaling 16 corresponding literary texts. In a series of corpus linguistic studies using Boolean and vector models, no conclusive evidence was found for the selected idiolect and sociolect hypotheses. In final analyses testing the semantics within each literary text, this lack of evidence was explained by the low homogeneity within a literary text."

The process started with an analysis of hand-written manuscripts and early printed books from different sources and ended with the electronic dictionary described in the present paper. Over these years, the conceptual structure, database schema, and requirements for essential use cases were iteratively developed. In our paper, we introduce the conceptual structure and database schema modelled for implementing an electronic dictionary that involves different use cases such as term insertion and linking a term to related concepts.

Thispaper proposes a Japanese/English CLIR system, where we combine aquery translation and retrieval modules. We currently target theretrieval of technical documents, and therefore the performance of oursystem is highly dependent on the quality of the translation oftechnical terms. However, the technical term translation is stillproblematic in that technical terms are often compound words, and thusnew terms are progressively created by combining existing basewords. In addition, Japanese often represents loanwords based on itsspecial phonogram. Consequently, existing dictionaries find itdifficult to achieve sufficient coverage. To counter the firstproblem, we produce a Japanese/English dictionary for base words, andtranslate compound words on a word-by-word basis. We also use aprobabilistic method to resolve translation ambiguity. For the secondproblem, we use a transliteration method, which corresponds wordsunlisted in the base word dictionary to their phonetic equivalents inthe target language. We evaluate our system using a test collectionfor CLIR, and show that both the compound word translation andtransliteration methods improve the system performance."

A variety of Berkeley FrameNet examples were chosen from different frames and then translated by professionals. The FinnFrameNet annotation team checked all the examples and their translations to see if the frames remained intact in translation. Problematic examples were tagged according to the type of the encountered problem, with the main focus on the type of fine-grained mismatches of meaning that caused frame changes even when the translation was the best possible one.

This study aims atpredicting the ideal size of suchautomatic-lexical-acquisition oriented corpora,focusing on six specific factors: (1) specificversus general purpose prediction, (2)variation among corpora, (3) base forms versus inflected forms, (4) open class items,(5) homographs, and (6) unknown words.Another important and related issue withregard to predictability has something to dowith data sparseness. Research using theTOTAL Corpus reveals serious datasparseness in this corpus. This, again, pointstowards the importance and necessity ofreducing data sparseness to a satisfactorylevel for the automatic lexical acquisition andreliable corpus predictions. The functions ofpredicting the number of tokens and lemmas in acorpus are based on the piecewisecurve-fitting algorithm. Unfortunately, thepredicted size of a corpus for automaticlexical acquisition is too astronomicalto compile it by using presently existingcompiling strategies. Therefore, we suggest apractical and efficient alternative method. Weare confident that this study will shed newlight on issues such as corpus predictability,compiling strategies and linguisticcomprehensiveness."
Renu BalyanNiladri Chatterjee,Language Resources and Evaluation,factor based evaluation for english to hindi mt outputs,2018,"Design and implementation of automatic evaluation methods is an integral part of any scientific research in accelerating the development cycle of the output. This is no less true for automatic machine translation (MT) systems. However, no such global and systematic scheme exists for evaluation of performance of an MT system. The existing evaluation metrics, such as BLEU, METEOR, TER, although used extensively in literature have faced a lot of criticism from users. Moreover, performance of these metrics often varies with the pair of languages under consideration. The above observation is no less pertinent with respect to translations involving languages of the Indian subcontinent. This study aims at developing an evaluation metric for English to Hindi MT outputs. As a part of this process, a set of probable errors have been identified manually as well as automatically. Linear regression has been used for computing weight/penalty for each error, while taking human evaluations into consideration. A sentence score is computed as the weighted sum of the errors. A set of 126 models has been built using different single classifiers and ensemble of classifiers in order to find the most suitable model for allocating appropriate weight/penalty for each error. The outputs of the models have been compared with the state-of-the-art evaluation metrics. The models developed for manually identified errors correlate well with manual evaluation scores, whereas the models for the automatically identified errors have low correlation with the manual scores. This indicates the need for further improvement and development of sophisticated linguistic tools for automatic identification and extraction of errors. Although many automatic machine translation tools are being developed for many different language pairs, there is no such generalized scheme that would lead to designing meaningful metrics for their evaluation. The proposed scheme should help in developing such metrics for different language pairs in the coming days."

We present a case study in which a set of LRs for different languages (WordNet for English and Spanish and Parole-Simple-Clips for Italian) are extended with Named Entities (NE) by exploiting Wikipedia and the aforementioned LRs. The practical result is a multilingual NE lexicon connected to these LRs and to two ontologies: SUMO and SIMPLE. Furthermore, the paper addresses an important problem which affects the Computational Linguistics area in the present, interoperability, by making use of the ISO LMF standard to encode this lexicon. The different steps of the procedure (mapping, disambiguation, extraction, NE identification and postprocessing) are comprehensively explained and evaluated. The resulting resource contains 974,567, 137,583 and 125,806 NEs for English, Spanish and Italian respectively. Finally, in order to check the usefulness of the constructed resource, we apply it into a state-of-the-art Question Answering system and evaluate its impact; the NE lexicon improves the system’s accuracy by 28.1%. Compared to previous approaches to build NE repositories, the current proposal represents a step forward in terms of automation, language independence, amount of NEs acquired and richness of the information represented."

Using lexical-semantic patterns, we mine the Web for evidence of the relative strength of adjectives like “large”, “huge” and “gigantic” with respect to their attribute (“size”). The pairwise orderings we derive allow us to construct scales on which the adjectives are located. To represent the intensity relation among gradable adjectives in WordNet, we combine ordered scales with the current WordNet dumbbells based on the relation between a pair of central adjectives and a group of undifferentiated semantically similar adjectives. A new intensity relation links the adjectives in the dumbbells and their concurrent representation on scales. Besides capturing the semantics of gradable adjectives in a way that is both intuitively clear as well as consistent with corpus data, the introduction of an intensity relation would potentially result in several specific benefits for NLP."

Yingjie ZhangBin LiXinyu DaiShujian HuangJiajun Chen,Language Resources and Evaluation,pqac wn constructing a wordnet for pre qin ancient chinese,2017,"The Princeton WordNet® (PWN) is a widely used lexical knowledge database for semantic information processing. There are now many wordnets under creation for languages worldwide. In this paper, we endeavor to construct a wordnet for Pre-Qin ancient Chinese (PQAC), called PQAC WordNet (PQAC-WN), to process the semantic information of PQAC. In previous work, most recently constructed wordnets have been established either manually by experts or automatically using resources from which translation pairs between English and the target language can be extracted. The former method, however, is time-consuming, and the latter method, owing to a lack of language resources, cannot be performed on PQAC. As a result, a method based on word definitions in a monolingual dictionary is proposed. Specifically, for each sense, kernel words are first extracted from its definition, and the senses of each kernel word are then determined by graph-based Word Sense Disambiguation. Finally, one optimal sense is chosen from the kernel word senses to guide the mapping between the word sense and PWN synset. In this research, we obtain 66 % PQAC senses that can be shared with English and another 14 % language-specific senses that were added to PQAC-WN as new synsets. Overall, the automatic mapping achieves a precision of over 85 %."
Francisco P. RomeroPascual Julián-IranzoAndrés SotoMateus Ferreira-SatlerJuan Gallardo-Casero,Language Resources and Evaluation,classifying unlabeled short texts using a fuzzy declarative approach,2013,"Web 2.0 provides user-friendly tools that allow persons to create and publish content online. User generated content often takes the form of short texts (e.g., blog posts, news feeds, snippets, etc). This has motivated an increasing interest on the analysis of short texts and, specifically, on their categorisation. Text categorisation is the task of classifying documents into a certain number of predefined categories. Traditional text classification techniques are mainly based on word frequency statistical analysis and have been proved inadequate for the classification of short texts where word occurrence is too small. On the other hand, the classic approach to text categorization is based on a learning process that requires a large number of labeled training texts to achieve an accurate performance. However labeled documents might not be available, when unlabeled documents can be easily collected. This paper presents an approach to text categorisation which does not need a pre-classified set of training documents. The proposed method only requires the category names as user input. Each one of these categories is defined by means of an ontology of terms modelled by a set of what we call proximity equations. Hence, our method is not category occurrence frequency based, but highly depends on the definition of that category and how the text fits that definition. Therefore, the proposed approach is an appropriate method for short text classification where the frequency of occurrence of a category is very small or even zero. Another feature of our method is that the classification process is based on the ability of an extension of the standard Prolog language, named  Bousi~Prolog , for flexible matching and knowledge representation. This declarative approach provides a text classifier which is quick and easy to build, and a classification process which is easy for the user to understand. The results of experiments showed that the proposed method achieved a reasonably useful performance."
Soonhee HwangAesun YoonHyuk-Chul Kwon,Language Resources and Evaluation,semantic representation of korean numeral classifier and its ontology building for hlt applications,2008,"The complexity of Korean numeral classifiers demands semantic as well as computational approaches that employ natural language processing (NLP) techniques. The classifier is a universal linguistic device, having the two functions of quantifying and classifying nouns in noun phrase constructions. Many linguistic studies have focused on the fact that numeral classifiers afford decisive clues to categorizing nouns. However, few studies have dealt with the semantic categorization of classifiers and their semantic relations to the nouns they quantify and categorize in building ontologies. In this article, we propose the semantic recategorization of the Korean numeral classifiers in the context of classifier ontology based on large corpora and KorLex Noun 1.5 (Korean wordnet; Korean Lexical Semantic Network), considering its high applicability in the NLP domain. In particular, the classifier can be effectively used to predict the semantic characteristics of nouns and to process them appropriately in NLP. The major challenge is to make such semantic classification and the attendant NLP techniques efficient. Accordingly, a Korean numeral classifier ontology (KorLexClas 1.0), including semantic hierarchies and relations to nouns, was constructed."

The implementation details of the methodology (choosing the most appropriate language-filtering words, the number of them, the most frequent inflections for the morphological query expansion, etc.) have been specified by corpora-based studies. The improvements produced have been measured in terms of precision and recall both over corpora and real web searches. Morphological query expansion can improve recall up to 47 % and language-filtering words can raise precision from 15 % to around 90 %, although with a loss in recall of about 30–35 %. The proposed methodology has already been successfully used in the Basque search service Elebila (http://www.elebila.eu) and the web-as-corpus tool CorpEus (http://www.corpeus.org), and the approach could be applied to other morphologically rich or under-resourced languages as well."

John Benjamins, Amsterdam/Philadelphia, 2010b), this study has three aims: (1) to adapt and evaluate the transferability and reliability of MIPVU for Mandarin Chinese; (2) to construct a corpus of Chinese texts annotated for metaphor using the adapted procedure; and (3) to examine the distribution of metaphor-related words across Chinese texts in three different written registers: academic discourse, fiction, and news. The results of our inter-annotator reliability test show that MIPVU can be reliably applied to linguistic metaphor identification in Chinese texts. Our metaphor-annotated corpus consists of texts randomly sampled from the Lancaster Corpus of Mandarin Chinese, totaling 30,012 words (about 10,000 for each register). Data analysis reveals that approximately one out of every nine lexical units in our Chinese corpus is related to metaphor, that there is considerable variation in metaphor density across different registers and lexical categories, and that metaphor density is significantly lower in Chinese than in English texts. Our assessment of the replicability of MIPVU for Mandarin Chinese adds to the groundbreaking methodological contribution that Steen et al. (2010a, b) has made to metaphor research. The metaphor-annotated corpus of Mandarin Chinese contributes a valuable language resource for Chinese metaphor researchers, and our analysis of the distribution of metaphor-related words in the corpus offers useful new insights into the extent and use of metaphor in Chinese discourse."

While building wordnets for Hindi and Marathi, two major Indo-European languages, we observed that the verb hierarchy in the Princeton Wordnet was rather shallow. We set to constructing a verb knowledge base for Hindi, which arranges the Hindi verbs in a hierarchy of is-a (hypernymy) relation. We realized that there are unique Indian language phenomena that bear upon the lexicalization vs. syntactically derived choice. One such example is the occurrence of conjunct and compound verbs (called Complex Predicates) which are found in all Indian languages. This paper presents our experience in the construction of lexical knowledge bases for Indian languages with special attention to Hindi. The question of storing versus deriving complex predicates has been dealt with linguistically and computationally. We have constructed empirical tests to decide if a combination of two words, the second of which is a verb, is a complex predicate or not. Such tests provide a principled way of deciding the status of complex predicates in Indian language wordnets."
Krister LindénJyrki Niemi,Language Resources and Evaluation,is it possible to create a very large wordnet in 100 days an evaluation,2014,"Wordnets are large-scale lexical databases of related words and concepts, useful for language-aware software applications. They have recently been built for many languages by using various approaches. The Finnish wordnet, FinnWordNet (FiWN), was created by translating the more than 200,000 word senses in the English Princeton WordNet (PWN) 3.0 in 100 days. To ensure quality, they were translated by professional translators. The direct translation approach was based on the assumption that most synsets in PWN represent language-independent real-world concepts. Thus also the semantic relations between synsets were assumed mostly language-independent, so the structure of PWN could be reused as well. This approach allowed the creation of an extensive Finnish wordnet directly aligned with PWN and also provided us with a translation relation and thus a bilingual wordnet usable as a dictionary. In this paper, we address several concerns raised with regard to our approach, many of them for the first time. We evaluate the craftsmanship of the translators by checking the spelling and translation quality, the viability of the approach by assessing the synonym quality both on the lexeme and concept level, as well as the usefulness of the resulting lexical resource both for humans and in a language-technological task. We discovered no new problems compared with those already known in PWN. As a whole, the paper contributes to the scientific discourse on what it takes to create a very large wordnet. As a side-effect of the evaluation, we extended FiWN to contain 208,645 word senses in 120,449 synsets, effectively making version 2.0 of FiWN currently the largest wordnet in the world by these statistics."

However, its exploitation in multilingual NLP has been limited by the fact that such classifications are available for few languages only. Since manual development of VerbNet is a major undertaking, researchers have recently translated VerbNet classes from English to other languages. However, no systematic investigation has been conducted into the applicability and accuracy of such a translation approach across different, typologically diverse languages. Our study is aimed at filling this gap. We develop a systematic method for translation of VerbNet classes from English to other languages which we first apply to Polish and subsequently to Croatian, Mandarin, Japanese, Italian, and Finnish. Our results on Polish demonstrate high translatability with all the classes (96% of English member verbs successfully translated into Polish) and strong inter-annotator agreement, revealing a promising degree of overlap in the resultant classifications. The results on other languages are equally promising. This demonstrates that VerbNet classes have strong cross-lingual potential and the proposed method could be applied to obtain gold standards for automatic verb classification in different languages.

Aina PerisMariona Taulé,Language Resources and Evaluation,annotating the argument structure of deverbal nominalizations in spanish,2012,"Over recent years, there has been a growing interest in the computational treatment of nominalized Noun Phrases due to the rich semantic information they contain. These Noun Phrases can be understood as verbal paraphrases and, just like them, they can also denote argument and thematic-role relations. This paper presents the methodology followed to annotate the argument structure of deverbal nominalizations in the Spanish AnCora-Es corpus. We focus on the automated annotation process that is mostly based on the semantic information specified in a verbal lexicon but also on the syntactic and semantic information annotated in the corpus. The heuristic rules that make use of this information rely on linguistic assumptions that are also evaluated as we evaluate the reliability of the automated process. The automated annotation was manually checked in order to ensure the accuracy of the final resource. We demonstrate its feasibility (77% F-measure) and show that it facilitates corpus annotation, which is always a time-consuming and costly process.

Ralf Steinberger,Language Resources and Evaluation,a survey of methods to ease the development of highly multilingual text mining applications,2012,"Multilingual text processing is useful because the information content found in different languages is complementary, both regarding facts and opinions. While Information Extraction and other text mining software can, in principle, be developed for many languages, most text analysis tools have only been applied to small sets of languages because the development effort per language is large. Self-training tools obviously alleviate the problem, but even the effort of providing training data and of manually tuning the results is usually considerable. In this paper, we gather insights by various multilingual system developers on how to minimise the effort of developing natural language processing applications for many languages. We also explain the main guidelines underlying our own effort to develop complex text mining software for tens of languages. While these guidelines—most of all: extreme simplicity—can be very restrictive and limiting, we believe to have shown the feasibility of the approach through the development of the Europe Media Monitor (EMM) family of applications (http://emm.newsbrief.eu/overview.html). EMM is a set of complex media monitoring tools that process and analyse up to 100,000 online news articles per day in between twenty and fifty languages. We will also touch upon the kind of language resources that would make it easier for all to develop highly multilingual text mining applications. We will argue that—to achieve this—the most needed resources would be freely available, simple, parallel and uniform multilingual dictionaries, corpora and software tools."
Collin F. Baker,Language Resources and Evaluation,framenet current collaborations and future goals,2012,"This paper will focus on recent and near-term future developments at FrameNet (FN) and the interoperability issues they raise. We begin by discussing the current state of the Berkeley FN database including major changes in the data format for the latest data release. We then briefly review two recent local projects, ""Rapid Vanguarding”, which has created a new interface for the frame and lexical unit definition process based on the Word Sketch Engine of Kilgarriff et al. (2004), and “Beyond the Core”, which has developed tools for annotating constructions, and created a sample “construction” of especially “interesting” constructions which are neither simply lexical nor easy for the standard parsers to parse. We also cover two current collaborations, FN’s part in the development of the manually annotated subcorpus of the American National Corpus, and a pilot study on aligning WordNet and FrameNet, to exploit the complementary strengths of these quite different resources. We discuss FN-related research on Spanish, Japanese, German (SALSA), Chinese and other languages, and the language-independence of frames, along with interesting FN-related work by others, and a sketch of a large group of image-schematic frames which are now being added to FN. We close with some ideas about how FrameNet can be opened up, to allow broader participation in the development process without losing precision and coherence, including a small-scale study on acquiring data for FN using Amazon’s Mechanical Turk crowd-sourcing system."

In this paper wepresent a fully-automated approach to theidentification of the authorship of unrestricted textthat excludes any lexical measure. Instead we adapt aset of style markers to the analysis of the textperformed by an already existing natural languageprocessing tool using three stylometric levels, i.e.,token-level, phrase-level, and analysis-levelmeasures. The latter represent the way in which thetext has been analyzed. The presented experiments ona Modern Greek newspaper corpus show that the proposedset of style markers is able to distinguish reliablythe authors of a randomly-chosen group and performsbetter than a lexically-based approach. However, thecombination of these two approaches provides the mostaccurate solution (i.e., 87% accuracy).

Kais DukesEric AtwellNizar Habash,Language Resources and Evaluation,supervised collaboration for syntactic annotation of quranic arabic,2013,"The Quranic Arabic Corpus (http://corpus.quran.com) is a collaboratively constructed linguistic resource initiated at the University of Leeds, with multiple layers of annotation including part-of-speech tagging, morphological segmentation (Dukes and Habash 2010) and syntactic analysis using dependency grammar (Dukes and Buckwalter 2010). The motivation behind this work is to produce a resource that enables further analysis of the Quran, the 1,400 year-old central religious text of Islam. This project contrasts with other Arabic treebanks by providing a deep linguistic model based on the historical traditional grammar known as i′rāb (إعراب). By adapting this well-known canon of Quranic grammar into a familiar tagset, it is possible to encourage online annotation by Arabic linguists and Quranic experts. This article presents a new approach to linguistic annotation of an Arabic corpus: online supervised collaboration using a multi-stage approach. The different stages include automatic rule-based tagging, initial manual verification, and online supervised collaborative proofreading. A popular website attracting thousands of visitors per day, the Quranic Arabic Corpus has approximately 100 unpaid volunteer annotators each suggesting corrections to existing linguistic tagging. To ensure a high-quality resource, a small number of expert annotators are promoted to a supervisory role, allowing them to review or veto suggestions made by other collaborators. The Quran also benefits from a large body of existing historical grammatical analysis, which may be leveraged during this review. In this paper we evaluate and report on the effectiveness of the chosen annotation methodology. We also discuss the unique challenges of annotating Quranic Arabic online and describe the custom linguistic software used to aid collaborative annotation."

Issues taken up include the representativeness and structure of corpora. Special attention is paid to pitfalls in the use of corpora.

We show that distinguishing senses at a coarse-grained level is a necessary part of specifying the semantic roles and describe our strategies for sense determination for purposes of predicate-argument structure specification. The semantic roles are postulated to account for syntactic variations, the different ways in which the semantic roles of a predicate are realized. The immediate purpose for this lexical semantic resource is to support the annotation of the Chinese PropBank, but we believe it can also serve as stepping stone for higher-level semantic generalizations."

Attila NovákKatalin GugánMónika VargaAdrienne Dömötör,Language Resources and Evaluation,creation of an annotated corpus of old and middle hungarian court records and private correspondence,2018,"
The paper introduces a novel annotated corpus of Old and Middle Hungarian (16–18 century), the texts of which were selected in order to approximate the vernacular of the given historical periods as closely as possible. The corpus consists of testimonies of witnesses in trials and samples of private correspondence. The texts are not only analyzed morphologically, but each file contains metadata that would also facilitate sociolinguistic research. The texts were segmented into clauses, manually normalized and morphosyntactically annotated using an annotation system consisting of the PurePos PoS tagger and the Hungarian morphological analyzer HuMor originally developed for Modern Hungarian but adapted to analyze Old and Middle Hungarian morphological constructions. The automatically disambiguated morphological annotation was manually checked and corrected using an easy-to-use web-based manual disambiguation interface. The normalization process and the manual validation of the annotation required extensive teamwork and provided continuous feedback for the refinement of the computational morphology and iterative retraining of the statistical models of the tagger. The paper discusses some of the typical problems that occurred during the normalization procedure and their tentative solutions. Besides, we also describe the automatic annotation tools, the process of semi-automatic disambiguation, and the query interface, a special function of which also makes correction of the annotation possible. Displaying the original, the normalized and the parsed versions of the selected texts, the beta version of the first fully normalized and annotated historical corpus of Hungarian is freely accessible at the address http://tmk.nytud.hu/."

After defining five linguistic varieties and 24 different registers based on these linguistic varieties, we collected texts for Peykare to do a linguistic analysis, including cross-register differences. For tokenization of Persian, we propose a descriptive generalization to normalize orthographic variations existing in texts. To annotate Peykare, we use EAGLES guidelines which result to have a hierarchy in the part-of-speech tags. To this aim, we apply a semi-automatic approach for the annotation methodology. In the paper, we also give a special attention to the Ezafe construction and homographs which are important in Persian text analyses."
Robin C. CoverPeter M. W. Robinson,Computers and the Humanities,encoding textual criticism,1995,"This paper chronicles the work of the TEI textual criticism working groups through several phases, documenting how and why the design goals were shaped by the requirements of several distinct user communities and by the nature of the textual evidence itself. Encoding schemes for the representation of physical details of textual witnesses were unified with encoding schemes for critical editing practices when it was observed that the two phenomena were inextricably layered and linked within real texts. Rationale is offered for the development teams' adherence to exceedingly general design principles: (a) the requirement that the encoding notations be neutral in text-theoretic terms; (b) the need to accommodate dramatically different text-transmission phenomena and research goals within diverse text-critical arenas; (c) the need for commensurability of the text-critical markup with encoding notations used in closely related text-analytic research. The paper also assesses the results of the effort in terms of the encoding scheme's adequacy for several scholarly purposes: suggestions are made concerning the need for programmatic testing, for refinement, and for extension of the encoding model to support a broader range of text-transmission phenomena and research objectives."

Xiaojuan Ma,Language Resources and Evaluation,evocation analyzing and propagating a semantic link based on free word association,2013,"Studies of lexical–semantic relations aim to understand the mechanism of semantic memory and the organization of the mental lexicon. However, standard paradigmatic relations such as “hypernym” and “hyponym” cannot capture connections among concepts from different parts of speech. WordNet, which organizes synsets (i.e., synonym sets) using these lexical–semantic relations, is rather sparse in its connectivity. According to WordNet statistics, the average number of outgoing/incoming arcs for the hypernym/hyponym relation per synset is 1.33. Evocation, defined as how much a concept (expressed by one or more words) brings to mind another, is proposed as a new directed and weighted measure for the semantic relatedness among concepts. Commonly applied semantic relations and relatedness measures do not seem to be fully compatible with data that reflect evocations among concepts. They are compatible but evocation captures MORE. This work aims to provide a reliable and extendable dataset of concepts evoked by, and evoking, other concepts to enrich WordNet, the existing semantic network. We propose the use of disambiguated free word association data (first responses to verbal stimuli) to infer and collect evocation ratings. WordNet aims to represent the organization of mental lexicon, and free word association which has been used by psycholinguists to explore semantic organization can contribute to the understanding. This work was carried out in two phases. In the first phase, it was confirmed that existing free word association norms can be converted into evocation data computationally. In the second phase, a two-stage association-annotation procedure of collecting evocation data from human judgment was compared to the state-of-the-art method, showing that introducing free association can greatly improve the quality of the evocation data generated. Evocation can be incorporated into WordNet as directed links with scales, and benefits various natural language processing applications."
Joel D. Goldfield,Computers and the Humanities,an argument for single author and similar studies using quantitative methods is there safety in numbers,1993,"Lack of a critical mass of scholars involved with the computer-assisted analysis of texts (CAAT), coupled with insufficient communication among various sectors of the literary and linguistic disciplines, has led to a skewed notion of computing humanists' work among their colleagues. This paper highlights the gap through examples of misunderstood humanist needs and achievements drawn from both recent media reports and humanities conferences. It suggests that networking and less modesty in manuscript submission can be at least partial solutions. The author cites some of his own published work and work-in-progress on Stendhal and Gobineau in refuting Mark Olsen's thesis that the dominance of single- or dual-author studies must be the cause of CAAT's “failure” to make significant inroads in mainstream literary journals. The author builds a case for the use of both diachronic and synchronic lexico-statistical data in carrying out such studies successfully. He recommends a new “Synthetic Criticism” where relevant quantitative methods would not be absent."

As a first step in this project, the present article proposes a linguistic analysis of requirements written in French by CNES engineers. One of our goals is to determine to what extent they conform to several rules laid down in two existing Controlled Natural Languages (CNLs), namely the Simplified Technical English developed by the AeroSpace and Defense Industries Association of Europe and the Guide for Writing Requirements proposed by the International Council on Systems Engineering. Indeed, although CNES engineers are not obliged to follow any controlled language in their writing of requirements, we believe that language regularities are likely to emerge from this task, mainly due to the writers’ experience. We are seeking to identify these regularities in order to use them as a basis for a new CNL for the writing of requirements. The issue is approached using natural language processing tools to identify sentences that do not comply with the rules or contain specific linguistic phenomena. We further review these sentences to understand why the recommendations cannot (or should not) always be applied when specifying large-scale projects."

Colin MartindaleDean McKenzie,Computers and the Humanities,on the utility of content analysis in author attributionthe federalist,1995,"In studies of author attribution, measurement of differential use of function words is the most common procedure, though lexical statistics are often used. Content analysis has seldom been employed. We compare the success of lexical statistics, content analysis, and function words in classifying the 12 disputedFederalist papers. Of course, Mosteller and Wallace (1964) have presented overwhelming evidence that all 12 were by James Madison rather than by Alexander Hamilton. Our purpose is not to challenge these attributions but rather to useThe Federalist as a test case. We found lexical statistics to be of no use in classifying the disputed papers. Using both classical canonical discriminant analysis and a neural-network approach, content analytic measures — the Harvard III Psychosociological Dictionary and semantic differential indices — were found to be successful at attributing most of the disputed papers to Madison. However, a function-word approach is more successful. We argue that content analysis can be useful in cases where the function-word approach does not yield compelling conclusions and, perhaps, in preliminary screening in cases where there are a large number of possible authors."

Systems participating in the task were presented with pairs of sentences and were evaluated on their ability to predict human judgments on (1) semantic relatedness and (2) entailment.
 Training and testing data were subsets of the SICK (Sentences Involving Compositional Knowledge) data set. SICK was developed with the aim of providing a proper benchmark to evaluate compositional semantic systems, though task participation was open to systems based on any approach. Taking advantage of the SemEval experience, in this paper we analyze the SICK data set, in order to evaluate the extent to which it meets its design goal and to shed light on the linguistic phenomena that are still challenging for state-of-the-art computational semantic systems.
 Qualitative and quantitative error analyses show that many systems are quite sensitive to changes in the proportion of sentence pair types, and degrade in the presence of additional lexico-syntactic complexities which do not affect human judgements. More compositional systems seem to perform better when the task proportions are changed, but the effect needs further confirmation.

These proposals emerge from special characteristics of language instruction and of the use of computers to assist in language instruction. We combine theoretically-based assumptions with empirical findings drawn from investigation of language courseware for Hebrew speakers in Israel. We first list four unique features of language instruction: (1) the object-language-meta-language distinction; (2) computer as written medium vs. language as primary spoken medium; (3) teaching of second language skills vs. linguistics; (4) the computer as an electronic tool vs. the computer as a cognitive entity simulating the speaker. We then show how these unique characteristics of language instruction (mother-tongue and foreign language) impose special proposals on language courseware. These proposals should be observed in the development of language courseware and in the evaluation of such programs. Clearly, these proposals integrate with general courseware proposals."

Traditional and contemporary reader response studies are also insufficiently empirical for reasons of sexual bias or flaws in research design."
Frank Smadja,Computers and the Humanities,xtract an overview,1992,"Lexical collocations have particular statistical distributions. We have developed a set of statistical techniques for retrieving and identifying collocations from large textual corpora. The techniques we developed are able to identify collocations of arbitrary length as well as flexible collocations. These techniques have been implemented in a lexicographic tool, Xtract, which is able to automatically acquire collocations with high retrieval performance. Xtract works in three stages. The first stage is based on a statistical technique for identifying word pairs involved in a syntactic relation. The words can appear in the text in any order and can be separated by an arbitrary number of other words. The second stage is based on a technique to extract n-word collocations (or n-grams) in a much simpler way than related methods. These collocations can involve closed class words such as particles and prepositions. A third stage is then applied to the output of stage one and applies parsing techniques to sentences involving a given word pair in order to identify the proper syntactic relation between the two words. A secondary effect of the third stage is to filter out a number of candidate collocations as irrelevant and thus produce higher quality output.

Unlike conventional style checkers, the system performs a complete syntactic analysis of its input, and takes the student's stylistic intent into account when providing a diagnosis. Named STASEL for Stylistic Treatment At the Sentence Level, the system is specifically developed for the teaching of style, and makes use of artificial intelligence techniques in natural language processing to analyze free-form input sentences interactively."
Donald Bruce,Computers and the Humanities,towards the implementation of text and discourse theory in computer assisted textual analysis,1993,"Humanities computing (HC) has failed to integrate into its practices many of the key theoretical elements of contemporary text and discourse theory. This has in turn contributed to the marginalization of HC in research and teaching. Outdated theoretical models must be abandoned in order to develop a critical discourse based on the insights of HC. HC projects remain far too attached to micro-analyses and have not developed the theoretical and methodological tools necessary to undertake systemic macro-analyses on the level of discourse. Given that texts are a mixture of determinate and dynamic systems, recent developments in chaos theory may be of help in modelling the interrelationship of these elements at discourse level."
Lee SigelmanColin MartindaleDean McKenzie,Computers and the Humanities,the common style of common sense,1996,The extraordinary impact of Thomas Paine's Common Sense has often been attributed to its style — to the simplicity and forcefulness with which Paine expressed ideas that many others before him had expressed. Comparative analysis of Common Sense and other pre-Revolutionary pamphlets suggests that Common Sense was indeed stylistically unique; no other pamphleteer came close to matching Paine's combination of simplicity and forcefulness.

Michael W. BerryPaul G. Young,Computers and the Humanities,using latent semantic indexing for multilanguage information retrieval,1995,"In this paper, a method for indexing cross-language databases for conceptual query matching is presented. Two languages (Greek and English) are combined by appending a small portion of documents from one language to the identical documents in the other language. The proposed merging strategy duplicates less than 7% of the entire database (made up of different translations of the Gospels). Previous strategies duplicated up to 34% of the initial database in order to perform the merger. The proposed method retrieves a larger number of relevant documents for both languages with higher cosine rankings when Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) is employed. Using the proposed merge strategies, LSI is shown to be effective in retrieving documents from either language (Greek or English) without requiring any translation of a user's query. An effective Bible search product needs to allow the use of natural language for searching (queries). LSI enables the user to form queries with using natural expressions in the user's own native language. The merging strategy proposed in this study enables LSI to retrieve relevant documents effectively using a minimum of the database in a foreign language."
Donald RossDavid Hunter,Computers and the Humanities, eyeball an interactive system for producing stylistic descriptions and comparisons,1994,"We have revised the mainframe EYEBALL, written in the early 1970s and used by several researchers during that decade, to run on microcomputers. This program parses English language texts and provides a statistical description of many linguistic features which are of interest to those involved in stylistics. In order to produce an analytical approach which goes beyond the simple reporting of linguistic data, we have selected a small number of features which characterize noticeable elements of the language used and we have written programs to facilitate statistical comparisons among texts. While EYEBALL is not automatic, the interactive parsing routines are elegant enough that the users spend most of their time confirming accurate guesses, rather than having to determine the structure of each phrase and clause. We hope that the program will be used by humanities scholars who have not previously been inclined to wrestle with the barriers of mainframe computing in the past."
Walter B. HewlettEleanor Selfridge-Field,Computers and the Humanities,computing in musicology 196691,1991,"While there are many parallels between computing activities in musicology and those in other humanities disciplines, the particular nature of musical material and the ways in which this must be accommodated set many activities apart from those in text-based disciplines. As in other disciplines, early applications were beset by hardware constraints, which placed a premium on expertise and promoted design-intensive projects. Massive musical encoding and bibliographical projects were initiated. Diversification of hardware platforms and languages in the Seventies led to task-specific undertakings, including preliminary work on many of today's programs for music printing and analysis. The rise of personal computers and associated general-purpose software in the Eighties has enabled many scholars to pursue projects individually, particularly with the assistance of database, word processing, and notation software. Current issues facing the field include the need for standards for data interchange, the creation of banks of reusable data, the establishment of qualitative standards for encoded data, and the encouragement of realistic appraisals of what computers can do."

Unlike most other SGML-based humanities computing projects which are tagging existing texts, we are researching and writing new material, including biographies, items of historical significance, and many kinds of literary and historical interpretation, all of which incorporates sophisticated SGML encoding for content as well as structure. We have created three DTDs, for biographies, for writing-related activities and publications, and for social, political and other events. A major factor influencing the design of the DTDs was the requirement to be able to merge and restructure the entire text base in many ways in order to retrieve and index it and to reflect multiple views and interpretations. In addition a stable and well-documented system for tagging was deemed essential for a team which involves almost twenty people, including eight graduate students, in two locations."
Nicholas V. Findler,Computers and the Humanities,automatic rule discovery for field work in anthropology,1992,"This paper deals with the problem of discovering rules that govern social interactions and relations in preliteral societies. Two older computer programs are first described which can receive data, possibly incomplete and redundant, representing kinship relations among named individuals. The programs then establish a knowledge base in the form of a directed graph, which the user can query in a variety of ways. Another program, written on the “top” of these (rewritten in LISP), can form concepts of various properties, including kinship relations, of and between the individuals. The concepts are derived from the examples and non-examples of a certain social pattern, such as inheritance, succession, marriage, class (tribe, moiety, clan, etc.) membership, domination-subordination, incest and exogamy. The concepts become hypotheses about the rules, which are corroborated, modified or rejected by further examples and non-examples."

Some large databases of melodies are now becoming available, and methods of control and checking are presented which are specially suited to these. Two applications are discussed in detail: to Gregorian Chant and to German folksong. An effective method in tonal and modal music is found to be the investigation of melodic progressions which remain unusual even after amalgamation by transposition to a central register."
Herbert Fiedler,Computers and the Humanities,computers and legal reasoning developments in germany,1991,"The importance of “reasoning” in law is pointed out. Law and jurisprudence belong to the “reasoning-conscious” disciplines. Accordingly, there is a long tradition of logic in law. The specific methods of professional work in law are to be seen in close connection with legal reasoning. The advent of computers at first did not touch upon legal reasoning (or the professional work in law). At first computers could be used only for general auxiliary functions (e.g., numerical calculations in tax law). Gradually, the use of computers for auxiliary functions in law has become more specific and more sophisticated (e.g., legal information retrieval), touching more closely upon professional legal work. Moreover, renewed interest in AI has also fostered interest in AI in law, especially for legal expert systems. AI techniques can be used in support of legal reasoning. Yet until now legal expert systems have remained in the research and development stage and have hardly succeeded in becoming a profitable tool for the profession. Therefore it is hoped that the two lines of computer support, for auxiliary functions in law and for immediate support of legal reasoning, may unite in the future."

A real time networking program (INTERCHANGE) was used for class discussion in freshman and senior literature courses and in a graduate humanities computing class. Pseudonyms, collaborative exams and essays, and computer-assisted reading were tested, along with organization of the students by sex and personality type.

His particular theory, however, is not transferable to literary studies. If we need a new model, I would suggest that cognitive science can provide a few interesting ones. I have begun to do some work based on David Marr's VISION, in which he hypothesizes two levels of processing within the visual module. My speculation has been on the parallel existence of distinguishable levels of conceptual or language organization which would correspond to the viewer and object centered perspectives Marr describes for vision. I propose to explore the possibility that we may find here the model for the existence of stylistic individualism within overarching historical stylistic generalizations, and even more, that this may be what feminists are searching for when they try to resist being coopted by the masculine language of objectivity."

Nevertheless, this report should prove useful in indicating the potentiality for analyzing the computerizedNewOED and some of the problems. This project is a study of the ways in which new words are created in English at various periods of time. A chronological dictionary 's created listing words introduced into the language over 50 year increments. These words are then classified by the processes used in forming them to show, in proportional terms, if certain processes are more common at some times than at others."
B. HabertC. Fabre,Computers and the Humanities,elementary dependency trees for identifying corpus specific semantic classes,1999,Elementary dependency relationships between words within parse trees produced by robust analyzers on a corpus help automate the discovery of semantic classes relevant for the underlying domain. We introduce two methods for extracting elementary syntactic dependencies from normalized parse trees. The groupings which are obtained help identify coarse-grain semantic categories and isolate lexical idiosyncrasies belonging to a specific sublanguage. A comparison shows a satisfactory overlapping with an existing nomenclature for medical language processing. This symbolic approach is efficient on medium size corpora which resist to statistical clustering methods but seems more appropriate for specialized texts.
Gwendal AuffretYannick Prié,Computers and the Humanities,managing full indexed audiovisual documents a new perspective for the humanities,1999,"The digitization of library documents and archives increasingly extends to audiovisual (AV) document repositories. As a consequence, new computer-aided techniques are being devised, providing opportunities for new uses of AV documents. As scholars work mainly by reading, annotating, reusing, and producing documents they are directly concerned by these changes. The first part of this article describes AV document use in the humanities, as well as the current and future influence computers might have on evolving practices. After establishing that “full-indexing” (indexing of the content for random access to any segment of an AV document) is a necessary condition if scholars are to develop new practices in using AV material, we will focus on the specific problems raised by AV indexing as opposed to text indexing, followed by a discussion of related AV indexing projects as well as standardization issues. The third part will propose a representation model for the description of AV material (AI-Strata) and an exchange format of AV annotations (AEDI), based on a free segmentation approach. An example of annotation is also provided. The last part is devoted to a discussion regarding potential long-term influences of digital AV indexing techniques on scholarly uses of AV documents."
Seonho KimJuntae YoonMansuk Song,Computers and the Humanities,automatic extraction of collocations from korean text,2001,"In this paper, we propose a statistical method to automaticallyextract collocations from Korean POS-tagged corpus. Since a large portion of language is represented by collocation patterns, the collocational knowledge provides a valuable resource for NLP applications. One difficulty of collocation extraction is that Korean has a partially free word order, which also appears in collocations. In this work, we exploit four statistics, ‘frequency’,‘randomness’, ‘convergence’, and ‘correlation' in order to take into account the flexible word order of Korean collocations. We separate meaningful bigrams using an evaluation function based on the four statistics and extend the bigrams to n-gram collocations using a fuzzy relation. Experiments show that this method works well for Korean collocations."

In the second part of the paper, historical serial documents are introduced, and the Ottoman Tax Registers (Defters) are taken as a case study. Their conformance to the data mining approach is established in terms of structure, analysis and results. A high-level conceptual model for the Defters is also presented. The final part concludes with a brief consideration of the implication of data mining for historical research."

The implemented export mechanism of the semantic mark up into NITF is also described in the paper. "
Andreas van CranenburghKarina van Dalen-OskamJoris van Zundert,Language Resources and Evaluation,vector space explorations of literary language,2019,"Literary novels are said to distinguish themselves from other novels through conventions associated with literariness. We investigate the task of predicting the literariness of novels as perceived by readers, based on a large reader survey of contemporary Dutch novels. Previous research showed that ratings of literariness are predictable from texts to a substantial extent using machine learning, suggesting that it may be possible to explain the consensus among readers on which novels are literary as a consensus on the kind of writing style that characterizes literature. Although we have not yet collected human judgments to establish the influence of writing style directly (we use a survey with judgments based on the titles of novels), we can try to analyze the behavior of machine learning models on particular text fragments as a proxy for human judgments. In order to explore aspects of the texts associated with literariness, we divide the texts of the novels in chunks of 2–3 pages and create vector space representations using topic models (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) and neural document embeddings (Distributed Bag-of-Words Paragraph Vectors). We analyze the semantic complexity of the novels using distance measures, supporting the notion that literariness can be partly explained as a deviation from the norm. Furthermore, we build predictive models and identify specific keywords and stylistic markers related to literariness. While genre plays a role, we find that the greater part of factors affecting judgments of literariness are explicable in bag-of-words terms,
 even in short text fragments and among novels with higher literary ratings. The code and notebook used to produce the results in this paper are available at https://github.com/andreasvc/litvecspace."

Jannik StrötgenMichael Gertz,Language Resources and Evaluation,multilingual and cross domain temporal tagging,2013,"Extraction and normalization of temporal expressions from documents are important steps towards deep text understanding and a prerequisite for many NLP tasks such as information extraction, question answering, and document summarization. There are different ways to express (the same) temporal information in documents. However, after identifying temporal expressions, they can be normalized according to some standard format. This allows the usage of temporal information in a term- and language-independent way. In this paper, we describe the challenges of temporal tagging in different domains, give an overview of existing annotated corpora, and survey existing approaches for temporal tagging. Finally, we present our publicly available temporal tagger HeidelTime, which is easily extensible to further languages due to its strict separation of source code and language resources like patterns and rules. We present a broad evaluation on multiple languages and domains on existing corpora as well as on a newly created corpus for a language/domain combination for which no annotated corpus has been available so far."

The corpus contains herbal texts printed between the fifteenth and nineteenth centuries and is concerned with the development of a German scientific register, independent of Latin. We will discuss difficulties of transcribing, normalizing and annotating historical texts and will thereby argue for the advantages of multiple layers and multiple tokenizations. A virtually infinite number of annotations can be added to the corpus, without the need for deciding between or discarding interpretations. Thus, this flexible architecture enables multiple normalizations and types of annotation and is open to a wide range of research questions in the humanities. We provide case studies concerning the exploitation of our different normalizations as well as structural, register-specific and linguistic annotations. The corpus architecture allows for its reuse as a resource for corpus-based research approaches."
Tomaž Erjavec,Language Resources and Evaluation,the imp historical slovene language resources,2015,"The paper describes the combined results of several projects which constitute a basic language resource infrastructure for printed historical Slovene. The IMP language resources consist of a digital library, an annotated corpus and a lexicon, which are interlinked and uniformly encoded following the Text Encoding Initiative Guidelines. The library holds about 650 units (mostly complete books) consisting of facsimiles with 45,000 pages as well as hand-corrected and structured transcriptions. The hand-annotated corpus has 300,000 tokens, where each word is tagged with its modernised word form, lemma, part-of-speech and, in cases of archaic words, its nearest contemporary equivalents. This information was extracted into the lexicon, which also covers an extended target-annotated corpus, resulting in 20,000 lemmas (of these 4,000 archaic) with 50,000 modern word forms and 70,000 attested forms. We have also developed a program to modernise, tag and lemmatise historical Slovene, and annotated the digital library with it, producing an automatically annotated corpus of 15 million words. To serve the humanities, the digital library and lexicon are available for reading and browsing on the web and the corpora via a concordancer. For language technology research and development the resources are available in source TEI XML under the Creative Commons Attribution licence.

Hugh Craig,Computers and the Humanities,contrast and change in the idiolects of ben jonson characters,1999,"The paper presents the results of a series of Principal Components Analyses of the frequencies of very common words in the dialogue of characters in plays by Ben Jonson. The first Principal Component in the data, the most important axis of differentiation, proves in each case to be a spectrum from elaborate, authoritative pronouncements to a dialogue style of reaction and interchange. Reference to other quantitative studies, literary and otherwise, suggests that a version of this axis may often be among the most important in stylistic difference generally. In Jonson it has a chronological aspect -- there is a shift over his career from one end to the other -- and there is often significant change within the idiolects of his characters as well. Successive segments of Volpone and Mosca's parts (they are protagonist and antagonist of Volpone, perhaps Jonson's best-known comedy) change markedly along this axis, beginning far apart but coming by the end of the play to resemble each other very closely on this measure."
M. W. A. Smith,Computers and the Humanities,virtuoso pianism from the qwerty keyboard the electronic realization of liszts scores,1995,"For a decade or so, Liszt thrilled and astounded audiences at a time when virtuosity (often as an end in itself) was the norm and the piano had rapidly evolved into a form recognisable as a close relative of the instrument we know today. During this period Liszt frequently performed hisGrandes Etudes (1838), which he had developed from his boyhoodEtude en 12 exercices (1826) and which he later revised and technically simplified asEtudes d'Exécution transcendante (1851). Although Liszt's own performances cannot be recreated, procedures for generating electronic realizations, which contain nuances of balance and tempo, are described. All three versions of the eighth of Liszt's set of 12 studies are used for illustration. Contrary to received opinion, it is argued that the 1838 version is more satisfying than the 1851 revision and that this is due to its formal structure."
Jay A. Leavitt,Computers and the Humanities,on the measurement of alliteration in poetry,1976,"This work is a preliminary study of methods to quantify alliteration. Ten pieces made up of poetry and prose (literary and non-literary) were used to create test sets. Three forms of each test set were examined: texts transcribed in IPA notational equivalent, in Chomsky and Halle features, and in Fromkin and Rodman features. Tests included the deletion of vowels, the weighting of the initial sounds, and the weighting of types according to their frequency in the population of the set. The various configurations were analyzed using a gap-recurrence method. Rankings were obtained by combining measures both of high frequency and of clustering properties. The resulting rankings compare not unfavorably with an intuitive ranking."

His oracles, mostly in poetry, are concerned with the contemporary political scene dominated by the Assyrians, with the fate of the Jewish people in history in general, with the mutual relationship between God and Man, and with the ultimate fate of Mankind in the fullness of time. For Jews, these oracles are perhaps second in importance only to the Pentateuch. For Christians, they are of greatest relevance because no other book influenced Jesus to the same extent. And for humanity they are so much the expression of an idealistic Weltanschauungthat they are quoted wherever educators and statesmen try to imbue their audiences with the vision of, and the hope for, a better world. They are collected in sixty-six chapters, constituting the first and longest book of the “Latter Prophets.”"

The language used in social media is often characterized by the abundance of informal and non-standard writing. The normalization of this non-standard language can be crucial to facilitate the subsequent textual processing and to consequently help boost the performance of natural language processing tools applied to social media text. In this paper we present a benchmark for lexical normalization of social media posts, specifically for tweets in Spanish language. We describe the tweet normalization challenge we organized recently, analyze the performance achieved by the different systems submitted to the challenge, and delve into the characteristics of systems to identify the features that were useful. The organization of this challenge has led to the production of a benchmark for lexical normalization of social media, including an evaluation framework, as well as an annotated corpus of Spanish tweets—TweetNorm_es—, which we make publicly available. The creation of this benchmark and the evaluation has brought to light the types of words that submitted systems did best with, and posits the main shortcomings to be addressed in future work."

The multimodality of the approach lies in the fact that both facial and gestural aspects of the user’s behavior are analyzed and processed. The mimicry consists of perception, interpretation, planning and animation of the expressions shown by the human, resulting not in an exact duplicate rather than an expressive model of the user’s original behavior."

We follow the methodology used in similar studies, including the survey of the IEEE ICASSP conference proceedings from 1976 to 1990, the survey of the Association of Computational Linguistics conference proceedings over 50 years, and the survey of the proceedings of the conferences contained in the ISCA Archive over 25 years (1987–2012). We expand on results originally presented at LREC 2014, but include the proceedings of LREC 2014 itself in the study together with an analysis of various citation graphs. We show the evolution over time of the number of papers and authors, including their distribution by gender and affiliation, as well as collaborations and citation patterns among authors and papers, funding sources for reported research, and plagiarism and reuse in LREC papers; results for LREC are compared with similar results for major conferences in related fields. We also consider the evolution of research topics over time and identify the authors who introduced key terms. Finally, we propose and apply a measure of a researcher’s notability and provide the results for LREC authors. The study uses NLP methods that have been published in the corpus considered in the study. In addition to providing a revealing characterization of the LRE community, the study also demonstrates the need for establishing a system for unique identification of authors, papers and other sources to facilitate this type of analysis."

Estelle Irizarry,Computers and the Humanities,exploring conscious imitation of style with ready made software,1989,"This article describes some approaches to imitation analysis and the use of ready-made software for this task. Devising computer-assisted techniques for exploring the conscious literary imitation of style is an application of particular relevance to contemporary Hispanic narrative and one that can be handled with a microcomputer and readily accessible software. The article describes some approaches to imitation analysis and the use of ready-made software to assess the effectiveness of stylistic imitation of eighteenth-century historical chronicle in La renuncia del héroe Baltasar (The Renunciation of the Hero Baltasar), by the Puerto Rican novelist Rodríguez Juliá. Even when employing familiar procedures of text analysis with computer, comparing a fictional text with a multiple and diverse corpus of authentic historical documents requires somewhat unique assumptions and hypotheses, since neither authorship, influence, or authenticity are in question."

We also present benchmark comparisons with other standard techniques for contrast and comparison."
Rosanne G. Potter,Computers and the Humanities,statistical analysis of literature a retrospective on computers and the humanities 19661990,1991,"This retrospective on statistical analysis of literature in the first twenty-four years of Computers and the Humanities divides the essays under review into four groups: the philosophical, the statistical analyses of language, the statistical analyses of literary texts, and the statistical analyses of themes. It begins with the question: must valid statistical analysis of any literary text be based on a complete linguistic description of the language of the text? It summarizes and evaluates over forty essays, giving details on works discussed, sample sizes used, statistical methods applied, and quotations from the researchers. The essay ends with a polemical summary of what has been done and what the future holds. It emphasizes the importance of extended pre-computational stages of learning about language and discourse analysis; reading previous research, building on and challenging theory; and the use of carefully crafted, small databases to test specific questions."
Charles Henry,Computers and the Humanities,the surface of language and humanities computing,1993,"Recent articles have noted that humanities computing techniques and methodologies remain marginal to mainstream literary scholarship. Mark Olsen's paper discusses this phenomenon and argues for large scale analyses of text databases that would incorporate a shift in theoretical orientation to include greater stress on intertextuality and sign theory. Part of Olsen's argument revolves on the need to move away from the syntactic and overt grammatical elements of textual language to more subtle semantics and meaning systems. While provocative and important, Olsen's stance remains rooted in literary theoretical constructs. Another level of language, the cognitive, offers equally interesting challenges for humanities computing, though the paradigms for this type of computer-based exploration are derived from disciplines traditionally removed from the humanities. The riddle, a nearly universal genre, offers a window onto some of the cognitive processes involved in deep level language function. By analyzing the riddling process, different methods of computational modelling can be inferred, suggesting new avenues for computing in the humanities."

Mark Hawthorne,Computers and the Humanities,the computer in literary analysis usingtact with students,1994,"TACT, a freeware program from the University of Toronto's Centre for Computing in the Humanities, is a highly sophisticated tool for text retrieval; although written for experienced critics and researchers, it can teach undergraduate students to read literature in new, fresh ways. Without requiring that the user become either a programmer, linguist, mathematician, or statistician,TACT introduces the literature student to the computer as a research tool. Studies of imagery and symbolism, of structural patterns, and of prosody can result from the student's careful tagging of a literary text and can yield significant insights into the work of literature. Students who use the computer as such a tool learn to read literary texts more closely and to think more clearly about literary problems."
Richard FrautschiPhilippe Thoiron,Computers and the Humanities,toward a narra topography a pilot study applied to marguerite duras novelmoderato cantabile,1993,"Although lexical frequencies are familiar measures of stylistic and thematic analysis, only recently have some stylostatisticians been tempted to investigate the relationship between the frequency and topography of repeated lexical items. In the present paper the authors have turned to the study of the four focal types of discursive narratology, using Marguerite Duras'Moderato Cantabile. Their intent is to uncover aspects of narratological performance which further elucidate the communicative strategies in the story. Part 1 summarizes the problematic between frequency and topography. It describes how a topographical index can be computed for any repeated item and how a Global Topography Index (GTI) can summarize the major topographical characteristics of any text sequence. Part 2 presents a four-cell typology of narrational mode: a segmentation of the verbal chain into narrating and narrated speech acts, with each text sequence tagged according to its discursive function: overt sender intervention for story coherence or comment on the focal level of a narrating present; representation of discrete or unlocalized events on the focal level of a mimeticized past. In Part 3 the focal encodings are displayed in numerical and graphic form, first according to the eight surface chapter divisions and then according to twenty-six subsets of approximately equal length. The fluctuations of the topography indices are reviewed, with particular attention being paid to the manifestation of cluster effects. Although sender interventions predominate, the relativized behavior of each focal type contributes to a climactic unraveling of the intrigue in the final chapters. In conclusion, the authors stress the dichotomy between the calm surface of the chapters and the agitated tensions of the twenty-six subsets."
Dean Keith Simonton,Computers and the Humanities,lexical choices and aesthetic success a computer content analysis of 154 shakespeare sonnets,1990,"A research paradigm is suggested that combines the perspectives of the humanistic scholar and the behavioral scientist: After differentiating the popularity of actual aesthetic products using archival indices and then subjecting these compositions to objective computer content analyses, further statistical treatment may divulge the intrinsic properties responsible for differences in impact. This approach is illustrated by an analysis of the 154 sonnets attributed to William Shakespeare. Each sonnet was partitioned into four consecutive units (three quatrains and a couplet), and then a computer gauged how the number of words, different words, unique words, primary process imagery, and secondary process imagery changed within each sonnet. Taking advantage of a previous objective measure of the relative aesthetic merit of the sonnets, and implementing a statistical search for interaction effects, it was demonstrated that Shakespeare's lexical choices adopt a discernible pattern in the highly popular creations that is not found in the more obscure poems. Perhaps the most fascinating aspect of this pattern shift is the distinct manner in which the poet modifies his vocabulary when composing the concluding couplet in his best sonnets."

Pierre MagistryAnne-Laure LigozatSophie Rosset,Language Resources and Evaluation,exploiting languages proximity for part of speech tagging of three french regional languages,2019,"This paper presents experiments in part-of-speech tagging of low-resource languages. It addresses the case when no labeled data in the targeted language and no parallel corpus are available. We only rely on the proximity of the targeted language to a better-resourced language. We conduct experiments on three French regional languages. We try to exploit this proximity with two main strategies: delexicalization and transposition. The general idea is to learn a model on the (better-resourced) source language, which will then be applied to the (regional) target language. Delexicalization is used to deal with the difference in vocabulary, by creating abstract representations of the data. Transposition consists in modifying the target corpus to be able to use the source models. We compare several methods and propose different strategies to combine them and improve the state-of-the-art of part-of-speech tagging in this difficult scenario."

In written responses to a questionnaire designed primarily to elicit advice about the subject content and focus of future projects, and in structured follow-up interviews, many respondents demonstrated a marked ambivalence towards the concept of digitized collections. Furthermore, if faced with a choice between fully searchable text and digitized facsimile images with traditional points of access (subject, author, title, etc.), there appears to be a preference for the latter means of access."

Corinne Jörgensen,Computers and the Humanities,access to pictorial material a review of current research and future prospects,1999,"Rapid expansion in the digitization of image and image collections has vastly increased the numbers of images available to scholars and researchers through electronic means. This research review will familiarize the reader with current research applicable to the development of image retrieval systems and provides additional material for exploring the topic further, both in print and online. The discussion will cover several broad areas, among them classification and indexing systems used for describing image collections and research initiatives into image access focusing on image attributes, users, queries, tasks, and cognitive aspects of searching. Prospects for the future of image access, including an outline of future research initiatives, are discussed. Further research in each of these areas will provide basic data which will inform and enrich image access system design and will hopefully provide a richer, more flexible, and satisfactory environment for searching for and discovering images. Harnessing the true power of the digital image environment will only be possible when image retrieval systems are coherently designed from principles derived from the fullest range of applicable disciplines, rather than from isolated or fragmented perspectives."

Yorick Wilks,Computers and the Humanities,on the ownership of text,2004,"The paper explores the notions of text ownership and its partial inverse, plagiarism, and asks how close or different they are from a procedural point of view that might seek to establish either of these properties. The emphasis is on procedures rather than on the conventional subject division of authorship studies, plagiarism detection etc. We use, as a particular example, our research on the notion of computational detection of text rewriting, in the benign sense of a standard journalist's adaptation of the Press Association newsfeed. The conclusion is that, whatever may be the case in copyright law, procedural detection and establishment of the ownership is a complex and vexed matter. Behind the paper is an unspoken appeal to return to an earlier historical phase, one where texts were normally rewritten and rewritten again and the ownership of text by an individual was a less clear matter than in historically recent times."

Neil Randall,Computers and the Humanities,determining literariness in interactive fiction,1988,"The authors of interactive fiction are beginning to demonstrate a concern for the literariness of their product. Literariness, as defined by Shklovskij and the Russian Formalists, is the quality of “making strange” that which is linguistically familiar, a quality Shklovskij termed ostranenie. By applying the principle of ostranenie, as well as other well-known literary principles, to the most serious interactive fictions, we can determine if this new genre exhibits the features of literariness. A study of Mindwheel, Brimstone, Breakers, A Mind Forever Voyaging, Portal, and Trinity suggest that the literariness of interactive fiction comes out of its concern both for “making strange” what is familiar and for “making familiar” what is strange."
Eva M. Thury,Computers and the Humanities,a study of words relating to youth and old age in the plays of euripides and its special implications for euripides suppliant women,1988,"This study focuses on the imagery of youth and old age in the plays of Euripides, especially the Suppliant Women, considering frequently used words in each play according to a formula developed by Guiraud. The study identifies a motif, the rejuvenation theme, an elaborate interaction between young and old, in the Suppliant Women and in: Alcestis, Heraclidae, Andromache, Hecabe, and Heracles. The difference between the use of neos (young, new) in the Suppliant Women and in the other plays is statistically significant. This word helps Euripides contrast two different kinds of youth: the fearful, rash, and animalistic (Theban); and that which has been properly schooled and led (Athenian). The greatest ground in the Suppliant Women for praising Athens is in her treatment of the young as a politically valuable force."

Application to the poems of the Shakespearean canon and to other contemporary poetry strongly supports the case for disqualification of most major claimants. Results also cast doubt that the recently discovered poems, Shall I Die and Elegy, were written by William Shakespeare, but do suggest that eight unascribed poems of The Passionate Pilgrim may have been his work."
Paul ThompsonRaheel NawazJohn McNaughtSophia Ananiadou,Language Resources and Evaluation,enriching news events with meta knowledge information,2017,"Given the vast amounts of data available in digitised textual form, it is important to provide mechanisms that allow users to extract nuggets of relevant information from the ever growing volumes of potentially important documents. Text mining techniques can help, through their ability to automatically extract relevant event descriptions, which link entities with situations described in the text. However, correct and complete interpretation of these event descriptions is not possible without considering additional contextual information often present within the surrounding text. This information, which we refer to as meta-knowledge, can include (but is not restricted to) the modality, subjectivity, source, polarity and specificity of the event. We have developed a meta-knowledge annotation scheme specifically tailored for news events, which includes six aspects of event interpretation. We have applied this annotation scheme to the ACE 2005 corpus, which contains 599 documents from various written and spoken news sources. We have also identified and annotated the words and phrases evoking the different types of meta-knowledge. Evaluation of the annotated corpus shows high levels of inter-annotator agreement for five meta-knowledge attributes, and moderate level of agreement for the sixth attribute. Detailed analysis of the annotated corpus has revealed further insights into the expression mechanisms of different types of meta-knowledge, their relative frequencies and mutual correlations."

Cyril LabbéDominique Labbé,Language Resources and Evaluation,how to measure the meanings of words amour in corneilles work,2005,"We present a new method to describe the contextual meaning of a key word in a corpus. The vocabulary of the sentences containing this word is compared to that of the entire corpus in order to highlight the words which are significantly overutilized in the neighbourhood of this key word (they are associated in the author’s mind) and the ones which are significantly underutilized (they are mutually exclusive). This method provides an interesting tool for lexicography and literary studies as is shown by applying it to the word amour (love) in the work of Pierre Corneille, the most famous French playwright of the 17th century."
Glòria VázquezAna Fernández-Montraveta,Language Resources and Evaluation,constructions at argument structure level in the sensem corpora,2015,"
In this paper we present the annotation scheme of constructions at the argument-structure level in the Spanish and Catalan Corpora SenSem. Constructions are accounted for as form-meaning pairs following the theoretical underpinning of Construction Grammar. Regarding meaning, we propose a hierarchy of constructions taking into account, at the highest level, the prominence of the logical subject in the sentence. Thus, we differentiate between topicalized and detopicalized sentences, which is an innovative proposal to solve some terminological issues related to pronominal constructions in Spanish. We further develop this classification taking into account the semantic relation of the logical subject with the verb and its coindexation, if any, with other participants. As regards form, the basic features we consider are syntagmatic categories and syntactic functions. Furthermore, we annotate the form the verb requires, that is, if it requires a pronoun in order to convey a particular meaning. Other relevant contributions are the annotation of some linguistic phenomena not taken into account in other similar resources, such as reciprocal, dative or impersonal constructions. Finally, we present the frequencies of all these constructions in Spanish."
Jonathon ReadJohn Carroll,Language Resources and Evaluation,annotating expressions of appraisal in english,2012,"In the context of Systemic Functional Linguistics, Appraisal is a theory describing the types of language utilised in communicating emotion and opinion. Robust automatic analyses of Appraisal could contribute in a number of ways to computational sentiment analysis by: distinguishing various types of evaluation, for example affect, ethics or aesthetics; discriminating between an author’s opinions and the opinions of authors referenced by the author and determining the strength of evaluations. This paper reviews the typology described by Appraisal, presents a methodology for annotating Appraisal, and the use of this to annotate a corpus of book reviews. It discusses an inter-annotator agreement study, and considers instances of systematic disagreement that indicate areas in which Appraisal may be refined or clarified. Although the annotation task is difficult, there are many instances where the annotators agree; these are used to create a gold-standard corpus for future experimentation with Appraisal."

Therefore the development of a treebank presents an opportunity to simultaneously enrich the lexicon. In building NorGramBank, we use an incremental parsebanking approach, in which a corpus is parsed and disambiguated, and after improvements to the grammar and the lexicon, reparsed. In this context we have implemented a text preprocessing interface where annotators can enter unknown words or missing lexical information either before parsing or during disambiguation. The information added to the lexicon in this way may be of great interest both to lexicographers and to other language technology efforts."
Geert BrôneBert Oben,Language Resources and Evaluation,insight interaction a multimodal and multifocal dialogue corpus,2015,"Research on the multimodal aspects of interactional language use requires high-quality multimodal resources. In contrast to the vast amount of available written language corpora and collections of transcribed spoken language, truly multimodal corpora including visual as well as auditory data are scarce. In this paper, we first discuss a few notable exceptions that do provide high-quality and multiple-angle video recordings of face-to-face conversations. We then present a new multimodal corpus design that adds two dimensions to the existing resources. First, the recording set-up was designed in such a way as to have a full view of the dialogue partners’ gestural behaviour, including hand gestures, facial expressions and body posture. Second, by recording the participant perspective and behaviour during conversation, using head-mounted scene cameras and eye-trackers, we obtained a 3D landscape of the conversation, with detailed production information (scene camera and sound) and indices of cognitive processing (eye movements for gaze analysis) for both participants. In its current form, the resulting InSight Interaction Corpus consists of 15 recorded face-to-face interactions of 20 min each, of which five have been transcribed and annotated for a range of linguistic and gestural features, using the ELAN multimodal annotation tool."

Muhammad SharjeelRao Muhammad Adeel NawabPaul Rayson,Language Resources and Evaluation,counter corpus of urdu news text reuse,2017,"Text reuse is the act of borrowing text from existing documents to create new texts. Freely available and easily accessible large online repositories are not only making reuse of text more common in society but also harder to detect. A major hindrance in the development and evaluation of existing/new mono-lingual text reuse detection methods, especially for South Asian languages, is the unavailability of standardized benchmark corpora. Amongst other things, a gold standard corpus enables researchers to directly compare existing state-of-the-art methods. In our study, we address this gap by developing a benchmark corpus for one of the widely spoken but under resourced languages i.e. Urdu. The COrpus of Urdu News TExt Reuse (COUNTER) corpus contains 1200 documents with real examples of text reuse from the field of journalism. It has been manually annotated at document level with three levels of reuse: wholly derived, partially derived and non derived. We also apply a number of similarity estimation methods on our corpus to show how it can be used for the development, evaluation and comparison of text reuse detection systems for the Urdu language. The corpus is a vital resource for the development and evaluation of text reuse detection systems in general and specifically for Urdu language."
Mohammad BahraniHossein SametiMehdi Hafezi Manshadi,Language Resources and Evaluation,a computational grammar for persian based on gpsg,2011,"In this paper, we present our attempts to design and implement a large-coverage computational grammar for the Persian language based on the Generalized Phrase Structured Grammar (GPSG) model. This grammatical model was developed for continuous speech recognition (CSR) applications, but is suitable for other applications that need the syntactic analysis of Persian. In this work, we investigate various syntactic structures relevant to the modern Persian language, and then describe these structures according to a phrase structure model. Noun (N), Verb (V), Adjective (ADJ), Adverb (ADV), and Preposition (P) are considered basic syntactic categories, and X-bar theory is used to define Noun phrases, Verb phrases, Adjective phrases, Adverbial phrases, and Prepositional phrases. However, we have to extend Noun phrase levels in X-bar theory to four levels due to certain complexities in the structure of Noun phrases in the Persian language. A set of 120 grammatical rules for describing different phrase structures of Persian is extracted, and a few instances of the rules are presented in this paper. These rules cover the major syntactic structures of the modern Persian language. For evaluation, the obtained grammatical model is utilized in a bottom-up chart parser for parsing 100 Persian sentences. Our grammatical model can take 89 sentences into account. Incorporating this grammar in a Persian CSR system leads to a 31% reduction in word error rate."
Joel TetreaultMartin ChodorowNitin Madnani,Language Resources and Evaluation,bucking the trend improved evaluation and annotation practices for esl error detection systems,2014,"The last decade has seen an explosion in the number of people learning English as a second language (ESL). In China alone, it is estimated to be over 300 million (Yang in Engl Today 22, 2006). Even in predominantly English-speaking countries, the proportion of non-native speakers can be very substantial. For example, the US National Center for Educational Statistics reported that nearly 10 % of the students in the US public school population speak a language other than English and have limited English proficiency (National Center for Educational Statistics (NCES) in Public school student counts, staff, and graduate counts by state: school year 2000–2001, 2002). As a result, the last few years have seen a rapid increase in the development of NLP tools to detect and correct grammatical errors so that appropriate feedback can be given to ESL writers, a large and growing segment of the world’s population. As a byproduct of this surge in interest, there have been many NLP research papers on the topic, a Synthesis Series book (Leacock et al. in Automated grammatical error detection for language learners. Synthesis lectures on human language technologies. Morgan Claypool, Waterloo 2010), a recurring workshop (Tetreault et al. in Proceedings of the NAACL workshop on innovative use of NLP for building educational applications (BEA), 2012), and a shared task competition (Dale et al. in Proceedings of the seventh workshop on building educational applications using NLP (BEA), pp 54–62, 2012; Dale and Kilgarriff in Proceedings of the European workshop on natural language generation (ENLG), pp 242–249, 2011). Despite this growing body of work, several issues affecting the annotation for and evaluation of ESL error detection systems have received little attention. In this paper, we describe these issues in detail and present our research on alleviating their effects."
Nicolas PécheuxAlexandre AllauzenJan NiehuesFrançois Yvon,Language Resources and Evaluation,reordering space design in statistical machine translation,2016,"In Statistical Machine Translation (SMT), the constraints on word reorderings have a great impact on the set of potential translations that is explored during search. Notwithstanding computational issues, the reordering space of a SMT system needs to be designed with great care: if a larger search space is likely to yield better translations, it may also lead to more decoding errors, because of the added ambiguity and the interaction with the pruning strategy. In this paper, we study the reordering search space, using a state-of-the art translation system, where all reorderings are represented in a permutation lattice prior to decoding. This allows us to directly explore and compare different reordering schemes and oracle settings. We also study in detail a rule-based preordering system, varying the length and number of rules, the tagset used, as well as contrasting with purely combinatorial subsets of permutations. We carry out experiments on three language pairs in both directions: English-French, a close language pair; English-German and English-Czech, two much more challenging pairs. We show that even though it might be desirable to design better reordering spaces, model and search errors seem to be the most important issues. Therefore, improvements of the reordering space should come along with improvements of the associated models to be really effective."
Junichi TsujiiSophia Ananiadou,Language Resources and Evaluation,thesaurus or logical ontology which one do we need for text mining,2005,"Ontologies are recognised as important tools, not only for effective and efficient information sharing, but also for information extraction and text mining. In the biomedical domain, the need for a common ontology for information sharing has long been recognised, and several ontologies are now widely used. However, there is confusion among researchers concerning the type of ontology that is needed for text mining , and how it can be used for effective knowledge management, sharing, and integration in biomedicine. We argue that there are several different ways to define an ontology and that, while the logical view is popular for some applications, it may be neither possible nor necessary for text mining. We propose a text-centered approach for knowledge sharing, as an alternative to formal ontologies. We argue that a thesaurus (i.e. an organised collection of terms enriched with relations) is more useful for text mining applications than formal ontologies."

In this paper, we present the browser-based gDelta tool, which aims to provide grammar engineers with more immediate feedback on the impact of changes made to a grammar by comparing parser output from two different grammar versions. We describe an attribute weighting algorithm for highlighting components of the grammar that have been strongly impacted by a modification to the grammar, as well as a technique for clustering test suite items whose parsability has changed, in order to locate related groups of effects. These two techniques are used to present the grammar engineer with different views on the grammar to inform them of different aspects of change in a data-driven manner."

The corpus used is the SEMAINE corpus, featuring four different personalities, further annotated for dialogue acts and prosodic features. In order to show the importance of the choice of dialogue act taxonomy, two different taxonomies were used, the first corresponding to Searle’s taxonomy of speech acts and the second, inspired by Bunt’s DIT++, including a division of directive acts into finer categories. Our results show that finer-grained distinctions are important when choosing a taxonomy. We also show with some preliminary results that the prosodic correlates of dialogue acts are not always as cited in the literature and prove more complex and variable. By studying the realisation of different directive acts, we also observe differences in the communicative strategies of the ECA depending on personality, in view to providing input to a speech system."
Cynthia Van HeeEls LefeverVéronique Hoste,Language Resources and Evaluation,exploring the fine grained analysis and automatic detection of irony on twitter,2018,"To push the state of the art in text mining applications, research in natural language processing has increasingly been investigating automatic irony detection, but manually annotated irony corpora are scarce. We present the construction of a manually annotated irony corpus based on a fine-grained annotation scheme that allows for identification of different types of irony. We conduct a series of binary classification experiments for automatic irony recognition using a support vector machine (SVM)  that exploits a varied feature set and compare this method to a deep learning approach that is based on an LSTM network and (pre-trained) word embeddings. Evaluation on a held-out corpus shows that the SVM model outperforms the neural network approach and benefits from combining lexical, semantic and syntactic information sources. A qualitative analysis of the classification output reveals that the classifier performance may be further enhanced by integrating implicit sentiment information and context- and user-based features."

We examine issues in establishing ground truth word sense labels using a fine-grained sense inventory from WordNet. Our data consist of a sentence corpus of 1,000 sentences: 100 for each of ten moderately polysemous words. Each word was given multiple sense labels—or a multilabel—from trained and untrained annotators. The multilabels give a nuanced representation of the degree of agreement on instances. A suite of assessment metrics is used to analyze the sets of multilabels, such as comparisons of sense distributions across annotators. Our assessment indicates that the general annotation procedure is reliable, but that words differ regarding how reliably annotators can assign WordNet sense labels, independent of the number of senses. We also investigate the performance of an unsupervised machine learning method to infer ground truth labels from various combinations of labels from the trained and untrained annotators. We find tentative support for the hypothesis that performance depends on the quality of the set of multilabels, independent of the number of labelers or their training."

Liza HasselEli Hagen,Language Resources and Evaluation,adaptation of an automotive dialogue system to users expertise and evaluation of the system,2006,"Spoken dialogue systems (SDSs) can be used to operate devices, e.g. in the automotive environment. People using these systems usually have different levels of experience. However, most systems do not take this into account. In this paper, we present a method to build a dialogue system in an automotive environment that automatically adapts to the user’s experience with the system. We implemented the adaptation in a prototype and carried out exhaustive tests. Our usability tests show that adaptation increases both user performance and user satisfaction. We describe the tests that were performed, and the methods used to assess the test results. One of these methods is a modification of PARADISE, a framework for evaluating the performance of SDSs [Walker MA, Litman DJ, Kamm CA, Abella A (Comput Speech Lang 12(3):317–347, 1998)]. We discuss its drawbacks for the evaluation of SDSs like ours, the modifications we have carried out, and the test results."

In this written version of an LREC conference keynote address, I describe the data and how it was created. If this is “killer” data, that presupposes a platform that it will “sell”; in this case, that is the NITE XML Toolkit, which allows a distributed set of users to create, store, browse, and search annotations for the same base data that are both time-aligned against signal and related to each other structurally."
Aynat Rubinstein,Language Resources and Evaluation,historical corpora meet the digital humanities the jerusalem corpus of emergent modern hebrew,2019,"The paper describes the creation of the first open access multi-genre historical corpus of Emergent Modern Hebrew, made possible by implementation of digital humanities methods in the process of corpus curation, encoding, and dissemination. Corpus contents originate in the Ben-Yehuda Project, an open access repository of Hebrew literature online, and in digital images curated from the collections of the National Library of Israel, a selection of which have been transcribed through a dedicated crowdsourcing task that feeds back into the library’s online catalog. Texts in the corpus are encoded following best practices in the digital humanities, including markup of metadata that enables time-sensitive research, linguistic and other, of the corpus. Evaluation of morphological analysis based on Modern Hebrew language models is shown to distinguish between genres in the historical variety, highlighting the importance of ephemeral materials for linguistic research and for potential collaboration with libraries and cultural institutions in the process of corpus creation. We demonstrate the use of the corpus in diachronic linguistic research and suggest ways in which the association it provides between digital images and texts can be used to support automatic language processing and to enhance resources in the digital humanities.

Reem F. Alfuraih,Language Resources and Evaluation,the undergraduate learner translator corpus a new resource for translation studies and computational linguistics,2019,"Around the world, a growing interest has been seen in learner translator corpora, which are invaluable resources for teaching and research. This paper introduces a new resource to support researchers from different interdisciplinary areas such as computational linguistics, descriptive translation studies, computer-aided translation technology, Arabic machine translation applications, cognitive science, and translation pedagogy. Motivated by the lack of learner translator resources that provide data about learners of translation from and into Arabic, the undergraduate learner translator corpus (ULTC) is an ongoing, error-tagged sentence-aligned parallel corpus of English, Arabic, and French, with Arabic as its main language. The present corpus, consisting of parallel texts of female learners of translation from English or French into Arabic, is the first of its kind in terms of the languages represented, tasks covered, and number of students involved. It is also unique in terms of combining many complementary corpora of cross-lingual data, each of which has its own web-based query interface and corpus analysis tools. This paper describes the ULTC compilation process, preliminary findings, and planned future expansion and research."

In the same project, a web concordancer was designed for the broadest possible use, and tailored to the needs and abilities of user groups such as translators, writers, proofreaders and teachers. Two years after the corpus was published within the new tool, its features were assessed by the users. With an average rate of 4.36 on a scale between 1 and 5 (1 = I strongly disagree, 5 = I strongly agree), the results indicate that most survey participants agreed or strongly agreed with positive statements about the new implementations (e.g. “The corpus results are displayed in a clear manner”). This is a considerable improvement in user experience from the previous reference corpus of Slovene, i.e. the FidaPLUS corpus within the ASP32 concordancer (rated with 3.67). In the user feedback, the simplicity of search options and the interface clarity are highlighted as the main advantages, while for the future development, advanced visualizations of corpus data and improved search of word-phrases are suggested. The evaluation also highlighted some relevant user habits, such as not taking the time to learn systematically about the tool before they start using it. The findings will be implemented in future editions of the Gigafida corpus, but are relevant to any project that aims at facilitating a wider use of reference corpora and corpus-based resources.

Dominic Dunlop,Computers and the Humanities,practical considerations in the use of tei headers in a large corpus,1995,"Many aspects of the guidelines of the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) are applicable to corpora and text collections, and to the texts that these contain. As the first large corpus developed using mark-up conforming to the guidelines, the British National Corpus (BNC) is a test-bed for many TEI-developed mechanisms. This is particularly true in the case of the TEI header, which has three intended applications — to describe a corpus, to describe an individual text, and as a free-standing bibliographic record — all of them used by the BNC. This paper describes the application of the TEI header to the BNC. It is intended that this information should, through a description of experience on a practical project, serve as a guide for those wishing to use TEI headers in the documentation and management of other corpora and collections of texts."

Aromo is a unit selection text-to-speech system, which employs diphones as units of synthesis. The key requirements and design criteria for Emilia were: to synthesize any text in Spanish into high-quality speech with a minimum corpus size. The text corpus was designed to guarantee the phonetic and prosodic coverage. A three-stage strategy was used: in the first stage, 741 sentences were designed with all of the syllables of Spanish spoken in Argentina, with and without stress, and in all positions within the word; in the second stage, 852 sentences were added to balance out the distribution of the diphones; and after a perceptual evaluation of the quality of synthesized speech, in the third and final stage, 625 sentences were added to achieve the specified unit coverage, and to introduce sentences with more complex syntactic and prosodic structures. Issues from all three corpus building stages are reported. The paper also presents the results from the quality perceptual evaluations of the synthesized voice. Emilia has a duration of three hours and 15 minutes; its speech quality synthesized with Aromo system is similar to the level obtained with commercial systems, with a real-time ratio less than one."
Ali SaeedRao Muhammad Adeel NawabMark StevensonPaul Rayson,Language Resources and Evaluation,a word sense disambiguation corpus for urdu,2019,"The aim of word sense disambiguation (WSD) is to correctly identify the meaning of a word in context. All natural languages exhibit word sense ambiguities and these are often hard to resolve automatically. Consequently WSD is considered an important problem in natural language processing (NLP). Standard evaluation resources are needed to develop, evaluate and compare WSD methods. A range of initiatives have lead to the development of benchmark WSD corpora for a wide range of languages from various language families. However, there is a lack of benchmark WSD corpora for South Asian languages including Urdu, despite there being over 300 million Urdu speakers and a large amounts of Urdu digital text available online. To address that gap, this study describes a novel benchmark corpus for the Urdu Lexical Sample WSD task. This corpus contains 50 target words (30 nouns, 11 adjectives, and 9 verbs). A standard, manually crafted dictionary called Urdu Lughat is used as a sense inventory. Four baseline WSD approaches were applied to the corpus. The results show that the best performance was obtained using a simple Bag of Words approach. To encourage NLP research on the Urdu language the corpus is freely available to the research community."
Kheireddine Abainia,Language Resources and Evaluation,dzdc12 a new multipurpose parallel algerian arabizifrench code switched corpus,2019,"Algeria’s socio-linguistic situation is known as a complex phenomenon involving several historical, cultural and technological factors. However, there are three languages that are mainly spoken in Algeria (Arabic, Tamazight and French) and they can be mixed in the same sentence (code-switching). Moreover, there are several varieties of dialects that differ from one region to another and sometimes within the same region. This paper aims to provide a new multi-purpose parallel corpus (i.e., DZDC12 corpus), which will serve as a testbed for various natural language processing and information retrieval applications. In particular, it can be a useful tool to study Arabic–French code-switching phenomenon, Algerian Romanized Arabic (Arabizi), different Algerian sub-dialects, sentiment analysis, gender writing style, machine translation, abuse detection, etc. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed corpus is the first of its kind, where the texts are written in Latin script and crawled from Facebook. More specifically, this corpus is organised by gender, region and city, and is transliterated into Arabic script and translated into Modern Standard Arabic. In addition, it is annotated for emotion detection and abuse detection, and annotated at the word level. This article focuses in particular on Algeria’s socio-linguistic situation and the effect of social media networks. Furthermore, the general guidelines for the design of DZDC12 corpus are described as well as the dialects clustering over the map.

 As Italian is under-represented in speech emotion research, for a comparison with the state-of-the-art, we model the ‘big 6 emotions’ and guilt. Besides making available this database for research, our contribution is three-fold: First, we employ a variety of mood induction procedures, whose combinations are especially tailored for specific emotions.
 Second, we use combinations of selection procedures such as an alexithymia test and self- and external assessment, obtaining 1,5 k (proto-) typical samples; these were used in a perception test (86 native Italian subjects, categorical identification and dimensional rating). Third, machine learning techniques—based on standardised brute-forced openSMILE ComParE features and support vector machine classifiers—were applied to assess how emotional typicality and sample size might impact machine learning efficiency.
 Our results are three-fold as well: First, we show that appropriate induction techniques ensure the collection of valid samples, whereas the type of self-assessment employed turned out not to be a meaningful measurement. Second, emotional typicality—which shows up in an acoustic analysis of prosodic main features—in contrast to sample size is not an essential feature for successfully training machine learning models. Third, the perceptual findings demonstrate that the confusion patterns mostly relate to cultural rules and to ambiguous emotions.

Jose Camacho-ColladosClaudio Delli BoviAlessandro RaganatoRoberto Navigli,Language Resources and Evaluation,sensedefs a multilingual corpus of semantically annotated textual definitions,2019,"Definitional knowledge has proved to be essential in various Natural Language Processing tasks and applications, especially when information at the level of word senses is exploited. However, the few sense-annotated corpora of textual definitions available to date are of limited size: this is mainly due to the expensive and time-consuming process of annotating a wide variety of word senses and entity mentions at a reasonably high scale. In this paper we present SenseDefs, a large-scale high-quality corpus of disambiguated definitions (or glosses) in multiple languages, comprising sense annotations of both concepts and named entities from a wide-coverage unified sense inventory. Our approach for the construction and disambiguation of this corpus builds upon the structure of a large multilingual semantic network and a state-of-the-art disambiguation system: first, we gather complementary information of equivalent definitions across different languages to provide context for disambiguation; then we refine the disambiguation output with a distributional approach based on semantic similarity. As a result, we obtain a multilingual corpus of textual definitions featuring over 38 million definitions in 263 languages, and we publicly release it to the research community. We assess the quality of SenseDefs’s sense annotations both intrinsically and extrinsically on Open Information Extraction and Sense Clustering tasks."

We report on our conversion of the preexisting and freely available Spoken Wikipedia into a speech resource. The Spoken Wikipedia project unites volunteer readers of Wikipedia articles. There are initiatives to create and sustain Spoken Wikipedia versions in many languages and hence the available data grows over time. Thousands of spoken articles are available to users who prefer a spoken over the written version. We turn these semi-structured collections into structured and time-aligned corpora, keeping the exact correspondence with the original hypertext as well as all available metadata. Thus, we make the Spoken Wikipedia accessible for sustainable research. We present our open-source software pipeline that downloads, extracts, normalizes and text–speech aligns the Spoken Wikipedia. Additional language versions can be exploited by adapting configuration files or extending the software if necessary for language peculiarities. We also present and analyze the resulting corpora for German, English, and Dutch, which presently total 1005 h and grow at an estimated 87 h per year. The corpora, together with our software, are available via http://islrn.org/resources/684-927-624-257-3/. As a prototype usage of the time-aligned corpus, we describe an experiment about the preferred modalities for interacting with information-rich read-out hypertext. We find alignments to help improve user experience and factual information access by enabling targeted interaction."
William A. GaleKenneth W. ChurchDavid Yarowsky,Computers and the Humanities,a method for disambiguating word senses in a large corpus,1992,"Word sense disambiguation has been recognized as a major problem in natural language processing research for over forty years. Both quantitive and qualitative methods have been tried, but much of this work has been stymied by difficulties in acquiring appropriate lexical resources. The availability of this testing and training material has enabled us to develop quantitative disambiguation methods that achieve 92% accuracy in discriminating between two very distinct senses of a noun. In the training phase, we collect a number of instances of each sense of the polysemous noun. Then in the testing phase, we are given a new instance of the noun, and are asked to assign the instance to one of the senses. We attempt to answer this question by comparing the context of the unknown instance with contexts of known instances using a Bayesian argument that has been applied successfully in related tasks such as author identification and information retrieval. The proposed method is probably most appropriate for those aspects of sense disambiguation that are closest to the information retrieval task. In particular, the proposed method was designed to disambiguate senses that are usually associated with different topics."

The objective of this work is to present a corpus of clinical narratives in French annotated for linguistic, semantic and structural information, aimed at clinical information extraction. Six annotators contributed to the corpus annotation, using a comprehensive annotation scheme covering 21 entities, 11 attributes and 37 relations. All annotators trained on a small, common portion of the corpus before proceeding independently. An automatic tool was used to produce entity and attribute pre-annotations. About a tenth of the corpus was doubly annotated and annotation differences were resolved in consensus meetings. To ensure annotation consistency throughout the corpus, we devised harmonization tools to automatically identify annotation differences to be addressed to improve the overall corpus quality. The annotation project spanned over 24 months and resulted in a corpus comprising 500 documents (148,476 tokens) annotated with 44,740 entities and 26,478 relations. The average inter-annotator agreement is 0.793 F-measure for entities and 0.789 for relations. The performance of the pre-annotation tool for entities reached 0.814 F-measure when sufficient training data was available. The performance of our entity pre-annotation tool shows the value of the corpus to build and evaluate information extraction methods.

This corpus is built by compiling multilingual search engines results where the queries are person names. Proper noun disambiguation is an open problem in natural language ambiguity resolution and, specifically, resolving the ambiguity of person names in Web search results is still a challenging problem. However, state-of-the-art approaches have been evaluated only with monolingual web page collections. The MC4WEPS corpus aims to provide the research community with a reference corpus for the task of disambiguating search engine results where the query is a person name shared by homonymous individuals. The features of this new corpus stand out from existing corpora for the same task, namely multilingualism and inclusion of social networking websites. These characteristics make it more representative of a real search scenario, especially for evaluating person name disambiguation in a multilingual context. The article also includes detailed information about the format and the availability of the corpus."

Hence the deepening of our understanding of human referential behaviour is indispensable for the creation of systems that collaborate with humans in a meaningful way. We present the construction of REX-J, a multi-modal Japanese corpus of referring expressions in situated dialogs, based on the collaborative task of solving the Tangram puzzle. This corpus contains 24 dialogs with over 4 h of recordings and over 1,400 referring expressions. We outline the characteristics of the collected data and point out the important differences from previous corpora. The corpus records extra-linguistic information during the interaction (e.g. the position of pieces, the actions on the pieces) in synchronization with the participants’ utterances. This in turn allows us to discuss the importance of creating a unified model of linguistic and extra-linguistic information from a new perspective. Demonstrating the potential uses of this corpus, we present the analysis of a specific type of referring expression (“action-mentioning expression”) as well as the results of research into the generation of demonstrative pronouns. Furthermore, we discuss some perspectives on potential uses of this corpus as well as our planned future work, underlining how it is a valuable addition to the existing databases in the community for the study and modeling of referring expressions in situated dialog."

Mary Ellen FosterJon Oberlander,Language Resources and Evaluation,corpus based generation of head and eyebrow motion for an embodied conversational agent,2007,"Humans are known to use a wide range of non-verbal behaviour while speaking. Generating naturalistic embodied speech for an artificial agent is therefore an application where techniques that draw directly on recorded human motions can be helpful. We present a system that uses corpus-based selection strategies to specify the head and eyebrow motion of an animated talking head. We first describe how a domain-specific corpus of facial displays was recorded and annotated, and outline the regularities that were found in the data. We then present two different methods of selecting motions for the talking head based on the corpus data: one that chooses the majority option in all cases, and one that makes a weighted choice among all of the options. We compare these methods to each other in two ways: through cross-validation against the corpus, and by asking human judges to rate the output. The results of the two evaluation studies differ: the cross-validation study favoured the majority strategy, while the human judges preferred schedules generated using weighted choice. The judges in the second study also showed a preference for the original corpus data over the output of either of the generation strategies."
Virginia FranciscoRaquel HervásFederico PeinadoPablo Gervás,Language Resources and Evaluation,emotales creating a corpus of folk tales with emotional annotations,2012,"Emotions are inherent to any human activity, including human–computer interactions, and that is the reason why recognizing emotions expressed in natural language is becoming a key feature for the design of more natural user interfaces. In order to obtain useful corpora for this purpose, the manual classification of texts according to their emotional content has been the technique most commonly used by the research community. The use of corpora is widespread in Natural Language Processing, and the existing corpora annotated with emotions support the development, training and evaluation of systems using this type of data. In this paper we present the development of an annotated corpus oriented to the narrative domain, called EmoTales, which uses two different approaches to represent emotional states: emotional categories and emotional dimensions. The corpus consists of a collection of 1,389 English sentences from 18 different folk tales, annotated by 36 different people. Our model of the corpus development process includes a post-processing stage performed after the annotation of the corpus, in which a reference value for each sentence was chosen by taking into account the tags assigned by annotators and some general knowledge about emotions, which is codified in an ontology. The whole process is presented in detail, and revels significant results regarding the corpus such as inter-annotator agreement, while discussing topics such as how human annotators deal with emotional content when performing their work, and presenting some ideas for the application of this corpus that may inspire the research community to develop new ways to annotate corpora using a large set of emotional tags."

 These two constitutive parts of the corpora are integrated by means of the intertextual correspondence between them. The rhetorical richness and high argument density of the communicative context results in cross-genre corpora that are robust resources for the study of the dialogical dynamics of argumentation in three ways: first, in empirical strands of research in discourse analysis and argumentation studies; second,
 in the burgeoning field of argument mining where automatic techniques require such data; and third, in formulating algorithmic techniques for sensemaking through the development of Argument Analytics.

Amir Zeldes,Language Resources and Evaluation,the gum corpus creating multilayer resources in the classroom,2017,"This paper presents the methodology, design principles and detailed evaluation of a new freely available multilayer corpus, collected and edited via classroom annotation using collaborative software. After briefly discussing corpus design for open, extensible corpora, five classroom annotation projects are presented, covering structural markup in TEI XML, multiple part of speech tagging, constituent and dependency parsing, information structural and coreference annotation, and Rhetorical Structure Theory analysis. Layers are inspected for annotation quality and together they coalesce to form a richly annotated corpus that can be used to study the interactions between different levels of linguistic description. The evaluation gives an indication of the expected quality of a corpus created by students with relatively little training. A multifactorial example study on lexical NP coreference likelihood is also presented, which illustrates some applications of the corpus. The results of this project show that high quality, richly annotated resources can be created effectively as part of a linguistics curriculum, opening new possibilities not just for research, but also for corpora in linguistics pedagogy."

Pascal DenisBenoît Sagot,Language Resources and Evaluation,coupling an annotated corpus and a lexicon for state of the art pos tagging,2012,"This paper investigates how to best couple hand-annotated data with information extracted from an external lexical resource to improve part-of-speech tagging performance. Focusing mostly on French tagging, we introduce a maximum entropy Markov model-based tagging system that is enriched with information extracted from a morphological resource. This system gives a 97.75 % accuracy on the French Treebank, an error reduction of 25 % (38 % on unknown words) over the same tagger without lexical information. We perform a series of experiments that help understanding how this lexical information helps improving tagging accuracy. We also conduct experiments on datasets and lexicons of varying sizes in order to assess the best trade-off between annotating data versus developing a lexicon. We find that the use of a lexicon improves the quality of the tagger at any stage of development of either resource, and that for fixed performance levels the availability of the full lexicon consistently reduces the need for supervised data by at least one half."

A corpus of French tales is presented. Its two parts, a text corpus and a speech corpus, were designed for studying the relationships between the textual structures of tales and speech prosody, with the targeted application of an expressive text-to-speech synthesis system embedded in a humanoid robot. The 89-tale text corpus, and the 12-tale speech corpus were annotated using a common tale description framework. Lexical level annotations include extended definitions of enumerations, time, place and person named entities, as well as part of speech tags. Supra-lexical level annotations include the segmentation of tales into a sequence of episodes, the localization and attribution of direct quotations, together with tale protagonists co-references. Annotation distributions and inter-annotator agreement were analyzed. The largest coverage and strongest agreement were observed for person named entities, characters’ direct quotations, and their associated coreference chains. Speech corpus annotations were extended to allow the analysis of the relations between tale linguistic information and prosodic properties observed in associated speech. Word and phoneme boundaries were inferred through semi-automatic procedures, resulting in linguistic annotations aligned with the speech signal. Intonation stylization models were used to ease the visual and statistical analysis of tale’s prosody. Additional meta-information is provided with the speech corpus, allowing describing tale characters according to their gender, age, size, valence and kind. The corpora described in this article are publicly available through the European Language Resources Association catalog."

This paper presents a historical Arabic corpus named HAC. At this early embryonic stage of the project, we report about the design, the architecture and some of the experiments which we have conducted on HAC. The corpus, and accordingly the search results, will be represented using a primary XML exchange format. This will serve as an intermediate exchange tool within the project and will allow the user to process the results offline using some external tools. HAC is made up of Classical Arabic texts that cover 1600 years of language use; the Quranic text, Modern Standard Arabic texts, as well as a variety of monolingual Arabic dictionaries. The development of this historical corpus assists linguists and Arabic language learners to effectively explore, understand, and discover interesting knowledge hidden in millions of instances of language use. We used techniques from the field of natural language processing to process the data and a graph-based representation for the corpus. We provided researchers with an export facility to render further linguistic analysis possible."

Ayla Rigouts TerrynVéronique HosteEls Lefever,Language Resources and Evaluation,in no uncertain terms a dataset for monolingual and multilingual automatic term extraction from comparable corpora,2019,"Automatic term extraction is a productive field of research within natural language processing, but it still faces significant obstacles regarding datasets and evaluation, which require manual term annotation. This is an arduous task, made even more difficult by the lack of a clear distinction between terms and general language, which results in low inter-annotator agreement. There is a large need for well-documented, manually validated datasets, especially in the rising field of multilingual term extraction from comparable corpora, which presents a unique new set of challenges. In this paper, a new approach is presented for both monolingual and multilingual term annotation in comparable corpora. The detailed guidelines with different term labels, the domain- and language-independent methodology and the large volumes annotated in three different languages and four different domains make this a rich resource. The resulting datasets are not just suited for evaluation purposes but can also serve as a general source of information about terms and even as training data for supervised methods. Moreover, the gold standard for multilingual term extraction from comparable corpora contains information about term variants and translation equivalents, which allows an in-depth, nuanced evaluation."

As a result of the contact between different languages and accents, the Algerian speech community has acquired a distinctive sociolinguistic situation. In addition to the intra- and inter- lingual variations describing day-to-day linguistic behavior of the Algerian speakers, their speech is characterized by the presence of many linguistic phenomena such as bilingualism and code switching. The study of automatic regional accent recognition in such a type of environment is a new idea in the field of automatic languages, dialect and accent recognition especially that previous studies were conducted using monolingual evaluation data. The assessment of the effectiveness of GMM-UBM and i-vectors frameworks for accent recognition approaches through the use of the Algerian Modern Colloquial Arabic Speech Corpus (AMCASC), which is a linguistic resource collected for this purpose, shows that not only the recording conditions mismatch, channels mismatch, recordings length mismatch and the amplitude clipping which have a non-desirable effect on the effectiveness of these acoustic approaches but also language contact phenomena are other perturbation sources which should be taken into consideration especially in real life applications

Amir HadifarSaeedeh Momtazi,Language Resources and Evaluation,the impact of corpus domain on word representation a study on persian word embeddings,2018,"Word embedding, has been a great success story for natural language processing in recent years. The main purpose of this approach is providing a vector representation of words based on neural network language modeling. Using a large training corpus, the model most learns from co-occurrences of words, namely Skip-gram model, and capture semantic features of words. Moreover, adding the recently introduced character embedding model to the objective function, the model can also focus on morphological features of words. In this paper, we study the impact of training corpus on the results of word embedding and show how the genre of training data affects the type of information captured by word embedding models. We perform our experiments on the Persian language. In line of our experiments, providing two well-known evaluation datasets for Persian, namely Google semantic/syntactic analogy and Wordsim353, is also part of the contribution of this paper. The experiments include computation of word embedding from various public Persian corpora with different genres and sizes while considering comprehensive lexical and semantic comparison between them. We identify words whose usages differ between these datasets resulted totally different vector representation which ends to significant impact on different domains in which the results vary up to 9% on Google analogy and up to 6% on Wordsim353. The resulted word embedding for each of the individual corpora as well as their combinations will be publicly available for any further research based on word embedding for Persian."

A key enabler for progress in this area is the availability of appropriate multimodal and multi-sensory corpora, annotated with rich human activity information during lectures and meetings. This paper is devoted to exactly such a corpus, developed in the framework of the European project CHIL, “Computers in the Human Interaction Loop”. The resulting data set has the potential to drastically advance the state-of-the-art, by providing numerous synchronized audio and video streams of real lectures and meetings, captured in multiple recording sites over the past 4 years. It particularly overcomes typical shortcomings of other existing databases that may contain limited sensory or monomodal data, exhibit constrained human behavior and interaction patterns, or lack data variability. The CHIL corpus is accompanied by rich manual annotations of both its audio and visual modalities. These provide a detailed multi-channel verbatim orthographic transcription that includes speaker turns and identities, acoustic condition information, and named entities, as well as video labels in multiple camera views that provide multi-person 3D head and 2D facial feature location information. Over the past 3 years, the corpus has been crucial to the evaluation of a multitude of audiovisual perception technologies for human activity analysis in lecture and meeting scenarios, demonstrating its utility during internal evaluations of the CHIL consortium, as well as at the recent international CLEAR and Rich Transcription evaluations. The CHIL corpus is publicly available to the research community."
Ekaterina ShutovaBarry J. DevereuxAnna Korhonen,Language Resources and Evaluation,conceptual metaphor theory meets the data a corpus based human annotation study,2013,"Metaphor makes our thoughts more vivid and fills our communication with richer imagery. Furthermore, according to the conceptual metaphor theory (CMT) of Lakoff and Johnson (Metaphors we live by. University of Chicago Press, Chicago, 1980), metaphor also plays an important structural role in the organization and processing of conceptual knowledge. According to this account, the phenomenon of metaphor is not restricted to similarity-based extensions of meanings of individual words, but instead involves activating fixed mappings that reconceptualize one whole area of experience in terms of another. CMT produced a significant resonance in the fields of philosophy, linguistics, cognitive science and artificial intelligence and still underlies a large proportion of modern research on metaphor. However, there has to date been no comprehensive corpus-based study of conceptual metaphor, which would provide an empirical basis for evaluating the CMT using real-world linguistic data. The annotation scheme and the empirical study we present in this paper is a step towards filling this gap. We test our annotation procedure in an experimental setting involving multiple annotators and estimate their agreement on the task. The goal of the study is to investigate (1) how intuitive the conceptual metaphor explanation of linguistic metaphors is for human annotators and whether it is possible to consistently annotate interconceptual mappings; (2) what are the main difficulties that the annotators experience during the annotation process; (3) whether one conceptual metaphor is sufficient to explain a linguistic metaphor or whether a chain of conceptual metaphors is needed. The resulting corpus annotated for conceptual mappings provides a new, valuable dataset for linguistic, computational and cognitive experiments on metaphor."

Previous attempts at collecting corpora to study emotions have shown that this data are often quite difficult to classify and analyse, and coding schemes to analyse emotions are often found not to be reliable. We collected a corpus of task-oriented (MapTask-style) dialogues in Italian, in which the segments of emotional interest are identified using psycho-physiological indexes (Heart Rate and Galvanic Skin Conductance) which are highly reliable. We then annotated these segments in accordance with novel multimodal annotation schemes for cooperation (in terms of effort) and facial expressions (an indicator of emotional state). High agreement was obtained among coders on all the features. The RECC corpus is to our knowledge the first resource with psycho-physiological data aligned with verbal and nonverbal behaviour data."

Johan BosJennifer Spenader,Language Resources and Evaluation,an annotated corpus for the analysis of vp ellipsis,2011,"Verb Phrase Ellipsis (VPE) has been studied in great depth in theoretical linguistics, but empirical studies of VPE are rare. We extend the few previous corpus studies with an annotated corpus of VPE in all 25 sections of the Wall Street Journal corpus (WSJ) distributed with the Penn Treebank. We annotated the raw files using a stand-off annotation scheme that codes the auxiliary verb triggering the elided verb phrase, the start and end of the antecedent, the syntactic type of antecedent (VP, TV, NP, PP or AP), and the type of syntactic pattern between the source and target clauses of the VPE and its antecedent. We found 487 instances of VPE (including predicative ellipsis, antecedent-contained deletion, comparative constructions, and pseudo-gapping) plus 67 cases of related phenomena such as do so anaphora. Inter-annotator agreement was high, with a 0.97 average F-score for three annotators for one section of the WSJ. Our annotation is theory neutral, and has better coverage than earlier efforts that relied on automatic methods, e.g. simply searching the parsed version of the Penn Treebank for empty VP’s achieves a high precision (0.95) but low recall (0.58) when compared with our manual annotation. The distribution of VPE source–target patterns deviates highly from the standard examples found in the theoretical linguistics literature on VPE, once more underlining the value of corpus studies. The resulting corpus will be useful for studying VPE phenomena as well as for evaluating natural language processing systems equipped with ellipsis resolution algorithms, and we propose evaluation measures for VPE detection and VPE antecedent selection. The stand-off annotation is freely available for research purposes."

Juan Antonio Prieto Velasco,Language Resources and Evaluation,a corpus based approach to the multimodal analysis of specialized knowledge,2013,"Modern communication environments have changed the cognitive patterns of individuals, who are now used to the interaction of information encoded in different semiotic modalities, especially visual and linguistic. Despite this, the main premise of Corpus Linguistics is still ruling: our perception of and experience with the world is conveyed in texts, which nowadays need to be studied from a multimodal perspective. Therefore, multimodal corpora are becoming extremely useful to extract specialized knowledge and explore the insights of specialized language and its relation to non-language-specific representations of knowledge. It is our assertion that the analysis of the image-text interface can help us understand the way visual and linguistic information converge in subject-field texts. In this article, we use Frame-based terminology to sketch a novel proposal to study images in a corpus rich in pictorial representations for their inclusion in a terminological resource on the environment. Our corpus-based approach provides the methodological underpinnings to create meaning within terminographic entries, thus facilitating specialized knowledge transfer and acquisition through images."
Amaç Herdağdelen,Language Resources and Evaluation,twitter n gram corpus with demographic metadata,2013,"Social media is a natural laboratory for linguistic and sociological purposes. In micro-blogging platforms such as Twitter, people share hundreds of millions of short messages about their lives and experiences on a daily basis. These messages, coupled with metadata about their authors, provide an opportunity to understand a wide variety of phenomena ranging from political polarization to geographic and demographic lexical variation. Lack of publicly available micro-blogging datasets has been a hindrance to replicable research. In this paper, I introduce Rovereto Twitter n-gram corpus, a publicly available n-gram dataset of Twitter messages, which contains gender-of-the-author and time-of-posting tags associated with the n-grams. I compare this dataset to a more traditional web-based corpus and present a case study which shows the potential of combining an n-gram corpus with demographic metadata."

This paper introduces the South East Asia Mandarin–English corpus, a 63-h spontaneous Mandarin–English code-switching transcribed speech corpus suitable for LVCSR and language change detection/identification research. The corpus is recorded under unscripted interview and conversational settings from 157 Singaporean and Malaysian speakers who spoke a mixture of Mandarin and English within a single sentence. About 82 % of the transcribed utterances are intra-sentential code-switching speech and the corpus will be release by LDC in 2015. This paper presents an analysis of the code-switching statistics of the corpus, such as the duration of monolingual segments and the frequency of language turns in code-switch utterances. We also summarize the development effort, details such as the processing time for transcription, validation and language boundary labelling. Lastly, we present textual analyses of code-switch segments examining the word length of monolingual segments in code-switch utterances and the most common single word and two-word phrase of such segments.

This paper discusses some pitfalls in corpus research and suggests solutions on the basis of examples and computer simulations. We first address reliability problems in language transcriptions, agreement between transcribers, and how disagreements can be dealt with. We then show that the frequencies of occurrence obtained from a corpus cannot always be analyzed with the traditional χ2 test, as corpus data are often not sequentially independent and unit independent. Next, we stress the relevance of the power of statistical tests, and the sizes of statistically significant effects. Finally, we point out that a t-test based on log odds often provides a better alternative to a χ2 analysis based on frequency counts."

Blogs are characterized by their evaluative use, in that they enable Internet users to express their opinion on a given subject. From this point of view, they are an ideal resource for the constitution of an annotated sentiment analysis corpus, crossing the subject and the opinion expressed on this subject. This paper presents the Blogoscopy corpus for the French language which was built up with personal thematic blogs. The annotation was governed by three principles: theoretical, as opinion is grounded in a linguistic theory of evaluation, practical, as every opinion is linked to an object, and methodological as annotation rules and successive phases are defined to ensure quality and thoroughness."
Hélène Bonneau-MaynardMatthieu QuignardAlexandre Denis,Language Resources and Evaluation,media a semantically annotated corpus of task oriented dialogs in french,2009,"The aim of the French Media project was to define a protocol for the evaluation of speech understanding modules for dialog systems. Accordingly, a corpus of 1,257 real spoken dialogs related to hotel reservation and tourist information was recorded, transcribed and semantically annotated, and a semantic attribute-value representation was defined in which each conceptual relationship was represented by the names of the attributes. Two semantic annotation levels are distinguished in this approach. At the first level, each utterance is considered separately and the annotation represents the meaning of the statement without taking into account the dialog context. The second level of annotation then corresponds to the interpretation of the meaning of the statement by taking into account the dialog context; in this way a semantic representation of the dialog context is defined. This paper discusses the data collection, the detailed definition of both annotation levels, and the annotation scheme. Then the paper comments on both evaluation campaigns which were carried out during the project and discusses some results."
Roser SauríJames Pustejovsky,Language Resources and Evaluation,factbank a corpus annotated with event factuality,2009,"Recent work in computational linguistics points out the need for systems to be sensitive to the veracity or factuality of events as mentioned in text; that is, to recognize whether events are presented as corresponding to actual situations in the world, situations that have not happened, or situations of uncertain interpretation. Event factuality is an important aspect of the representation of events in discourse, but the annotation of such information poses a representational challenge, largely because factuality is expressed through the interaction of numerous linguistic markers and constructions. Many of these markers are already encoded in existing corpora, albeit in a somewhat fragmented way. In this article, we present FactBank, a corpus annotated with information concerning the factuality of events. Its annotation has been carried out from a descriptive framework of factuality grounded on both theoretical findings and data analysis. FactBank is built on top of TimeBank, adding to it an additional level of semantic information."

We provide an answer to the what-question by describing the importance and particularities of compiling and processing a corpus for pedagogical purposes. In order to answer the how-question, we first investigate the central concepts of the interactionist theory of second language acquisition: comprehensible input, input enhancement, comprehensible output and output enhancement. By means of two case studies, we illustrate how the abovementioned concepts can be realized in concrete corpus-based language learning activities. We propose a design for a receptive and productive language task and describe how a parallel corpus can be at the basis of powerful language learning activities. The Dutch Parallel Corpus, a ten-million word sentence aligned and annotated parallel corpus, is used to develop these language tasks."

The paper presents the Chinese Discourse TreeBank, a corpus annotated with Penn Discourse TreeBank style discourse relations that take the form of a predicate taking two arguments. We first characterize the syntactic and statistical distributions of Chinese discourse connectives as well as the role of Chinese punctuation marks in discourse annotation, and then describe how we design our annotation strategy procedure based on this characterization. The Chinese-specific features of our annotation strategy include annotating explicit and implicit discourse relations in one single pass, defining the argument labels on semantic, rather than syntactic, grounds, as well as annotating the semantic type of implicit discourse relations directly. We also introduce a flat, 11-valued semantic type classification scheme for discourse relations. We finally demonstrate the feasibility of our approach with evaluation results."

In particular, SPARTAN-derived corpora outperform all corpora based on existing techniques for the task of term recognition."
Paul CookLaurel J.

Although very large English corpora have been built, only relatively small corpora are available for many varieties of English. National top-level domains (e.g., .au, .ca) could be exploited to automatically build web corpora, but it is unclear whether such corpora would reflect the corresponding national varieties of English; i.e., would a web corpus built from the .ca domain correspond to Canadian English? In this article we build web corpora from national top-level domains corresponding to countries in which English is widely spoken. We then carry out statistical analyses of these corpora in terms of keywords, measures of corpus comparison based on the Chi-square test and spelling variants, and the frequencies of words known to be marked in particular varieties of English. We find evidence that the web corpora indeed reflect the corresponding national varieties of English. We then demonstrate, through a case study on the analysis of Canadianisms, that these corpora could be valuable lexicographical resources."

Three subjects participated in each conversational group, and they had conversations on free-flowing and goal-oriented topics in Japanese and in English. Their utterances, eye gazes, and gestures were recorded with microphones, eye trackers, and video cameras. The utterances and eye gazes were manually annotated. Their utterances were transcribed, and the transcriptions of each participant were aligned with those of the others along the time axis. Quantitative analyses were made to compare the communicative activities caused by the differences in conversational languages, the conversation types, and the levels of language expertise in L2. The results reveal different utterance characteristics and gaze patterns that reflect the differences in difficulty felt by the participants in each conversational condition. Both total and average durations of utterances were shorter in their L2 than in their L1 conversations. Differences in eye gazes were mainly found in those toward the information senders: Speakers were gazed at more in their second-language than in their native-language conversations. Our findings on the characteristics of conversations in the second language suggest possible directions for future research in psychology, cognitive science, and human–computer interaction technologies."
Jakub Kabala,Language Resources and Evaluation,computational authorship attribution in medieval latin corpora the case of the monk of lido ca 110108 and gallus anonymous ca 111317,2018,"This paper applies computational methods of authorship attribution to shed light on a still open question concerning two Latin works of the twelfth century: are the anonymous authors of the Translatio s. Nicolai (ca. 1101–1108) and the Gesta principum polonorum (ca. 1113–1117) one and the same person? The Translatio was written by the so-called Monk of Lido and describes Venice’s role in the First Crusade. The Gesta were written by the so-called Gallus Anonymous and contain a panegyric of the contemporary Polish ruler, Bolesław III the Wry-Mouthed (r. 1102–1138). This study attributes authorship to these works within four corpora of Latin texts composed between the tenth and twelfth centuries, each with between 39 and 116 texts written by between 15 and 22 different authors. The goal of including four corpora is to see how robust the similarity between the target texts is to changes in text length, genre, and class balance in the corpora. In each corpus, nine different distance metrics and one machine-learning algorithm are used to classify the authors of the Translatio and Gesta. I conclude that it is highly likely that Gallus and Monk were indeed one and same anonymous author, and highlight the effectiveness of the Bray–Curtis distance and logistic regression as methods of attribution.

We describe three increasingly complex algorithms: a simple baseline iterative method, and two non-iterative more elaborated versions. While the baseline algorithm is mainly described for illustrative purposes, the non-iterative algorithms outline the use of different working hypotheses which may be motivated by different kinds of applications and to some extent by the languages concerned. The first two algorithms rely on cross-lingual POS preservation, while with the third one POS invariance is not an extraction condition. The evaluation of the algorithms was conducted on three different corpora and several pairs of languages."
Jáchym Kolář,Language Resources and Evaluation,design creation and analysis of czech corpora for structural metadata extraction from speech,2011,"Structural metadata extraction (MDE) research aims to develop techniques for automatic conversion of raw speech recognition output to forms that are more useful to humans and downstream automatic processes. The MDE annotation includes inserting boundaries of sentence-like units to the flow of speech, labeling non-content words like filled pauses and discourse markers for optional removal, and identifying sections of disfluent speech. This paper describes design, creation, and analysis of data resources for structural MDE from spoken Czech. The annotation is based on the LDC’s MDE annotation standard for English, with changes applied to accommodate specific phenomena of Czech. In addition to the necessary language-dependent modifications, we further proposed and applied several language-independent modifications slightly refining the original annotation scheme. We created two Czech MDE speech corpora—one in the domain of broadcast news and the other in the domain of broadcast conversations. Both corpora have already been published at LDC. The analysis section of this paper presents a variety of statistics about fillers, edit disfluencies, and sentence-like units. The two Czech corpora are not only compared with each other, but also with statistics relating to the available English MDE corpora. We also report the statistics indicating that edit disfluencies have a different part of speech (POS) distribution in comparison with the overall POS distribution. The findings from the corpus analysis should help guide strategies for developing automatic MDE systems."

Thispaper proposes an empirical method of description of lexical richness byaveraging measures on multiple chunks of text of a standard lengthwithin a literary work or corpus. A workss average vocabulary richness,average portion of hapax legomenaof the corpus from which it derives,and average repetition of frequently appearing vocabulary may thencharacterize that work relative to other works partitioned along withit. This method reveals the possibility of significant variance of thesemeasures of vocabulary among works of a single authorss corpus and warnsagainst the notion of some absolute authorial stylistic character. Weapply this method of vocabulary averaging to the corpora of threeplaywrights from classical antiquity whose works are chronologicallyrankable: Euripides, Aristophanes, and Terence. We look for trends in vocabulary richness over time, which we posit functions as anindicator of progressively changing authorial ability or inclination. This method then holds the potential of predicting datesfor undateable or tenuously dated works within a corpus of otherwisesecurely dated texts. From the results derived, a relatively late date forthe composition of the redrafted version ofAristophaness Clouds appearslikely; we predict an early composition date for the redraft of TerencessHecyra (and thus are inclined to think that the playwright did verylittle redrafting); and finally we findEuripidess Electra andSupplices exhibiting vocabulary characteristics of extremely latecomposition and we predict dates much later than those assigned based onmetrical considerations."

However, currently there is no genre-annotated corpus of web pages where inter-annotator reliability has been established, i.e. the corpora are either not tested for inter-annotator reliability or exhibit low inter-coder agreement. Annotation has also mostly been carried out by a small number of experts, leading to concerns with regard to scalability of these annotation efforts and transferability of the schemes to annotators outside these small expert groups. In this paper, we tackle these problems by using crowd-sourcing for genre annotation, leading to the Leeds Web Genre Corpus—the first web corpus which is, demonstrably reliably annotated for genre and which can be easily and cost-effectively expanded using naive annotators.

The speech corpus contains a total of 415 sentences recorded by 40 (20 male and 20 female) Arabic native speakers from 11 different Arab countries representing three major regions (Levant, Gulf, and Africa). Three hundred and sixty seven sentences are considered as phonetically rich and balanced, which are used for training Arabic Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems. The rich characteristic is in the sense that it must contain all phonemes of Arabic language, whereas the balanced characteristic is in the sense that it must preserve the phonetic distribution of Arabic language. The remaining 48 sentences are created for testing purposes, which are mostly foreign to the training sentences and there are hardly any similarities in words. In order to evaluate the speech corpus, Arabic ASR systems were developed using the Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) Sphinx 3 tools at both training and testing/decoding levels. The speech engine uses 3-emitting state Hidden Markov Models (HMM) for tri-phone based acoustic models. Based on experimental analysis of about 8 h of training speech data, the acoustic model is best using continuous observation’s probability model of 16 Gaussian mixture distributions and the state distributions were tied to 500 senones. The language model contains uni-grams, bi-grams, and tri-grams. For same speakers with different sentences, Arabic ASR systems obtained average Word Error Rate (WER) of 9.70%. For different speakers with same sentences, Arabic ASR systems obtained average WER of 4.58%, whereas for different speakers with different sentences, Arabic ASR systems obtained average WER of 12.39%."

Gabriela FerraroRogelio NazarMargarita Alonso RamosLeo Wanner,Language Resources and Evaluation,towards advanced collocation error correction in spanish learner corpora,2014,"Collocations in the sense of idiosyncratic binary lexical co-occurrences are one of the biggest challenges for any language learner. Even advanced learners make collocation mistakes in that they literally translate collocation elements from their native tongue, create new words as collocation elements, choose a wrong subcategorization for one of the elements, etc. Therefore, automatic collocation error detection and correction is increasingly in demand. However, while state-of-the-art models predict, with a reasonable accuracy, whether a given co-occurrence is a valid collocation or not, only few of them manage to suggest appropriate corrections with an acceptable hit rate. Most often, a ranked list of correction options is offered from which the learner has then to choose. This is clearly unsatisfactory. Our proposal focuses on this critical part of the problem in the context of the acquisition of Spanish as second language. For collocation error detection, we use a frequency-based technique. To improve on collocation error correction, we discuss three different metrics with respect to their capability to select the most appropriate correction of miscollocations found in our learner corpus."

Because of practical constraints, the amount of speech per language is relatively small compared to major corpora in world languages, and we report on our investigation of the stability of the ASR models derived from the corpus. We also report on phoneme distance measures across languages, and describe initial phone recognisers that were developed using this data. We find that a surprisingly small number of speakers (fewer than 50) and around 10 to 20 h of speech per language are sufficient for the purposes of acceptable phone-based recognition."
Mikel IruskietaIria da CunhaMaite Taboada,Language Resources and Evaluation,a qualitative comparison method for rhetorical structures identifying different discourse structures in multilingual corpora,2015,"Explaining why the same passage may have different rhetorical structures when conveyed in different languages remains an open question. Starting from a trilingual translation corpus, this paper aims to provide a new qualitative method for the comparison of rhetorical structures in different languages and to specify why translated texts may differ in their rhetorical structures. To achieve these aims we have carried out a contrastive analysis, comparing a corpus of parallel English, Spanish and Basque texts, using Rhetorical Structure Theory. We propose a method to describe the main linguistic differences among the rhetorical structures of the three languages in the two annotation stages (segmentation and rhetorical analysis). We show a new type of comparison that has important advantages with regard to the quantitative method usually employed: it provides an accurate measurement of inter-annotator agreement, and it pinpoints sources of disagreement among annotators. With the use of this new method, we show how translation strategies affect discourse structure."
Lianet Sepúlveda-TorresMagali Sanches DuranSandra Maria Aluísio,Language Resources and Evaluation,automatic detection and correction of discourse marker errors made by spanish native speakers in portuguese academic writing,2019,"Discourse markers are words and expressions (such as: firstly, then, for example, because, as a result, likewise, in comparison, in contrast) that explicitly state the relational structure of the information in the text, i.e. signalling a sequential relationship between the current message and the previous discourse. Using these markers improves the cohesion and coherence of texts, facilitating reading comprehension. Although often included in tools that support the rhetoric structuring of texts, discourse markers have hardly been explored in writing support tools for learners of a second language. However, learners of a second language, including those at advanced levels, have trouble producing these lexical items, frequently replacing them with items from their native language or with literal translations of items in their own language, which often do not result in proper lexical items in the second language. In addition, students learn a single marker per function and use it repeatedly, producing monotonous texts. With the aim of contributing to reducing these difficulties, this paper presents a lexicon that will be used to support the task of automatically detecting and correcting discourse marker errors. Several heuristics have been evaluated to generate different types of errors. Automatic translation methods were used to semi-automatically compile the lexicon used in these heuristics. Similarity measures were also combined with these heuristics to correct discourse marker errors. The evaluated methods proved to be suitable for the task of identifying some types of discourse marker errors and can potentially identify many others, as long as new lexical inputs are incorporated into them."

Themain goal of the initiative was to set up a framework for evaluation of Word Sense Disambiguation systems (WSDS) through the comparative analysis of their performance on the same type of data. In this experiment there are two aspects which are of relevance: first, the preparation of the reference annotated corpus, and, second, the evaluation of the systems against it. In both aspects we are mainly interested here in the analysis of the linguistic side which can lead to a better understanding of the problem of semantic annotation of a corpus, be itmanual or automatic annotation. In particular, we will investigate, firstly, the reasons for disagreement between human annotators, secondly, some linguistically relevant aspects of the performance of the Italian WSDS and, finally, the lessons learned from the present experiment."

Shinsuke MoriGraham Neubig,Language Resources and Evaluation,a comparative study of dictionaries and corpora as methods for language resource addition,2016,"In this paper, we investigate the relative effect of two strategies for language resource addition for Japanese morphological analysis, a joint task of word segmentation and part-of-speech tagging. The first strategy is adding entries to the dictionary and the second is adding annotated sentences to the training corpus. The experimental results showed that addition of annotated sentences to the training corpus is better than the addition of entries to the dictionary. In particular, adding annotated sentences is especially efficient when we add new words with contexts of several real occurrences as partially annotated sentences, i.e. sentences in which only some words are annotated with word boundary information. According to this knowledge, we performed real annotation experiments on invention disclosure texts and observed word segmentation accuracy. Finally we investigated various language resource addition cases and introduced the notion of non-maleficence, asymmetricity, and additivity of language resources for a task. In the WS case, we found that language resource addition is non-maleficent (adding new resources causes no harm in other domains) and sometimes additive (adding new resources helps other domains). We conclude that it is reasonable for us, NLP tool providers, to distribute only one general-domain model trained from all the language resources we have."

 Our survey of text analysis packages includes those of our own creation (cleanNLP and fasttextM) as well as packages built by other research groups (stringi, readtext, hyphenatr, quanteda, and hunspell). By operating on generic object types, these packages unite research innovations in corpus linguistics, natural language processing, machine learning, statistics, and digital humanities. We begin by extrapolating on the theoretical benefits of R as an elaborate gluing language for bringing together several areas of expertise and compare it to linguistic concordancers and other tool-based approaches to text analysis in the digital humanities. We then showcase the practical benefits of an ecosystem by illustrating how R packages have been integrated into a digital humanities project. Throughout, the focus is on moving beyond the bag-of-words, lexical frequency model by incorporating linguistically-driven analyses in research.

Darinka VerdonikMatej RojcMarko Stabej,Language Resources and Evaluation,annotating discourse markers in spontaneous speech corpora on an example for the slovenian language,2007,"Speech-to-speech translation technology has difficulties processing elements of spontaneity in conversation. We propose a discourse marker attribute in speech corpora to help overcome some of these problems. There have already been some attempts to annotate discourse markers in speech corpora. However, as there is no consistency on what expressions count as discourse markers, we have to reconsider how to set a framework for annotating, and, in order to better understand what we gain by introducing a discourse marker category, we have to analyse their characteristics and functions in discourse. This is especially important for languages such as Slovenian where no or little research on the topic of discourse markers has been carried out. The aims of this paper are to present a scheme for annotating discourse markers based on the analysis of a corpus of telephone conversations in the tourism domain in the Slovenian language, and to give some additional arguments based on the characteristics and functions of discourse markers that confirm their special status in conversation."
Erwin MarsiEmiel Krahmer,Language Resources and Evaluation,construction of an aligned monolingual treebank for studying semantic similarity,2014,"Modern paraphrase research would benefit from large corpora with detailed annotations. However, currently these corpora are still thin on the ground. In this paper, we describe the development of such a corpus for Dutch, which takes the form of a parallel monolingual treebank consisting of over 2 million tokens and covering various text genres, including both parallel and comparable text. This publicly available corpus is richly annotated with alignments between syntactic nodes, which are also classified using five different semantic similarity relations. A quarter of the corpus is manually annotated, and this informs the development of an automatic tree aligner used to annotate the remainder of the corpus. We argue that this corpus is the first of this size and kind, and offers great potential for paraphrasing research."
Rejwanul HaqueSergio PenkaleAndy Way,Language Resources and Evaluation,termfinder log likelihood comparison and phrase based statistical machine translation models for bilingual terminology extraction,2018,"Bilingual termbanks are important for many natural language processing applications, especially in translation workflows in industrial settings. In this paper, we apply a log-likelihood comparison method to extract monolingual terminology from the source and target sides of a parallel corpus. The initial candidate terminology list is prepared by taking all arbitrary n-gram word sequences from the corpus. Then, a well-known statistical measure (the Dice coefficient) is employed in order to remove any multi-word terms with weak associations from the candidate term list. Thereafter, the log-likelihood comparison method is applied to rank the phrasal candidate term list. Then, using a phrase-based statistical machine translation model, we create a bilingual terminology with the extracted monolingual term lists. We integrate an external knowledge source—the Wikipedia cross-language link databases—into the terminology extraction (TE) model to assist two processes: (a) the ranking of the extracted terminology list, and (b) the selection of appropriate target terms for a source term. First, we report the performance of our monolingual TE model compared to a number of the state-of-the-art TE models on English-to-Turkish and English-to-Hindi data sets. Then, we evaluate our novel bilingual TE model on an English-to-Turkish data set, and report the automatic evaluation results. We also manually evaluate our novel TE model on English-to-Spanish and English-to-Hindi data sets, and observe excellent performance for all domains."
Jonas Kuhn,Language Resources and Evaluation,computational text analysis within the humanities how to combine working practices from the contributing fields,2019,"This position paper is based on a keynote presentation at the COLING 2016 Workshop on Language Technology for Digital Humanities in Osaka, Japan. It departs from observations about working practices in Humanities disciplines following a hermeneutic tradition of text interpretation versus the method-oriented research strategies in Computational Linguistics (CL). The respective praxeological traditions are quite different. Yet more and more researchers are willing to open up towards truly transdisciplinary collaborations, trying to exploit advanced methods from CL within research that ultimately addresses questions from the traditional Humanities disciplines and the Social Sciences. The article identifies two central workflow-related issues for this type of collaborative project in the Digital Humanities (DH) and Computational Social Science: (1) a scheduling dilemma, which affects the point in the course of the project when specifications of the core analysis task are fixed (as early as possible from the computational perspective, but as late as possible from the Humanities perspective) and (2) the subjectivity problem, which concerns the degree of intersubjective stability of the target categories of analysis. CL methodology demands high inter-annotator agreement and theory-independent categories, while the categories in hermeneutic reasoning are often tied to a particular interpretive approach (viz. a theory of literary interpretation) and may bear a non-trivial relation to a reader’s pre-understanding. Building a comprehensive methodological framework that helps overcome these issues requires considerable time and patience. The established computational methodology has to be gradually opened up to more hermeneutically oriented research questions; resources and tools for the relevant categories of analysis have to be constructed. This article does not call into question that well-targeted efforts along this path are worthwhile. Yet, it makes the following additional programmatic point regarding directions for future research: It might be fruitful to explore—in parallel—the potential lying in DH-specific variants of the concept of rapid prototyping from Software Engineering. To get an idea of how computational analysis of some aspect of text might contribute to a hermeneutic research question, a prototypical analysis model is constructed, e.g., from related data collections and analysis categories, using transfer techniques. While the initial quality of analysis may be limited, the idea of rapid probing allows scholars to explore how the analysis fits in an actual workflow on the target text data and it can thus provide early feedback for the process of refining the modeling. If the rapid probing method can indeed be incorporated in a hermeneutic framework to the satisfaction of well-disposed Humanities scholars, a swifter exploration of alternative paths of analysis would become possible. This may generate considerable additional momentum for transdisciplinary integration. It is as yet too early to point to truly Humanities-oriented examples of the proposed rapid probing technique. To nevertheless make the programmatic idea more concrete, the article uses two experimental scenarios to argue how rapid probing might help addressing the scheduling dilemma and the subjectivity problem respectively. The first scenario illustrates the transfer of complex analysis pipelines across corpora; the second one addresses rapid annotation experiments targeting character mentions in literary text."

The development path is motivated by the encouraging empirical results of TimeML-compliant annotators developed on the basis of TimeBank 1.1, and is informed by a detailed study of the characteristics of that initial release, which guides a clean-up process turning TimeBank 1.2 into a consistent and robust community resource."
Kam-Fai WongYunqing Xia,Language Resources and Evaluation,normalization of chinese chat language,2008,"Real-time communication platforms such as ICQ, MSN and online chat rooms are getting more popular than ever on the Internet. There are, however, real risks where criminals and terrorists can perpetrate illegal and criminal abuses. This highlights the security significance of accurate detection and translation of the chat language to its stand language counterpart. The language used on these platforms differs significantly from the standard language. This language, referred to as chat language, is comparatively informal, anomalous and dynamic. Such features render conventional language resources such as dictionaries, and processing tools such as parsers ineffective. In this paper, we present the NIL corpus, a chat language text collection annotated to facilitate training and testing of chat language processing algorithms. We analyse the NIL corpus to study the linguistic characteristics and contextual behaviour of a chat language. First we observe that majority of the chat terms, i.e. informal words in a chat text, is formed by phonetic mapping. We then propose the eXtended Source Channel Model (XSCM) for the normalization of the chat language, which is a process to convert messages expressed in a chat language to its standard language counterpart. Experimental results indicate that the performance of XSCM in terms of chat term recognition and normalization accuracy is superior to its Source Channel Model (SCM) counterparts, and is also more consistent over time."
Neil Taylor KleynhansEtienne Barnard,Language Resources and Evaluation,efficient data selection for asr,2015,"Automatic speech recognition (ASR) technology has matured over the past few decades and has made significant impacts in a variety of fields, from assistive technologies to commercial products. However, ASR system development is a resource intensive activity and requires language resources in the form of text annotated audio recordings and pronunciation dictionaries. Unfortunately, many languages found in the developing world fall into the resource-scarce category and due to this resource scarcity the deployment of ASR systems in the developing world is severely inhibited. One approach to assist with resource-scarce ASR system development, is to select “useful” training samples which could reduce the resources needed to collect new corpora. In this work, we propose a new data selection framework which can be used to design a speech recognition corpus. We show for limited data sets, independent of language and bandwidth, the most effective strategy for data selection is frequency-matched selection and that the widely-used maximum entropy methods generally produced the least promising results. In our model, the frequency-matched selection method corresponds to a logarithmic relationship between accuracy and corpus size; we also investigated other model relationships, and found that a hyperbolic relationship (as suggested from simple asymptotic arguments in learning theory) may lead to somewhat better performance under certain conditions."

First, we construct simulated texts in accordance with the assumptions implicit in the underlying model and use these to validate the basic computations, to determine their range of applicability, and to evaluate their sensitivity to basic lexical parameters. Second, we experiment with actual texts from the Shakespearean canon and the plays of Christopher Marlowe. The results of the tests are mixed, showing good consistency for the Shakespeare plays (with some discrimination among early, middle and late works) but poor consistency between Shakespeare's poems and plays, or among Marlowe's plays."
Eugenia EumeridouBlaise Nkwenti-AzehJohn McNaught,Computers and the Humanities,an analysis of verb subcategorization frames in three special language corpora with a view towards automatic term recognition,2004,"Current term recognition algorithms havecentred mostly on the notion of term based onthe assumption that terms are monoreferentialand as such independent of context. Thecharacteristics and behaviour of terms in realtexts are however far removed from this idealbecause factors such as text type orcommunicative situation greatly influence thelinguistic realisation of a concept. Context,therefore, is important for the correctidentification of terms (Dubuc and Lauriston,1997). Based on this assumption, we haveshifted our emphasis from terms towardssurrounding linguistic context, namely verbs,as verbs are considered the central elements inthe sentence. More specifically, we have setout to examine whether verbs and verbal syntaxin particular, could help us towards the taskof automatic term recognition. Our findingssuggest that term occurrence variessignificantly in different argument structuresand different syntactic positions. Additionally, deviant grammatical structureshave proved rich environments for terms. Theanalysis was carried out in three differentspecialised subcorpora in order to explore howthe effectiveness of verbal syntax as apotential indicator of term occurrence can beconstrained by factors such as subject matterand text type."

Roland Schäfer,Language Resources and Evaluation,accurate and efficient general purpose boilerplate detection for crawled web corpora,2017,"Removal of boilerplate is one of the essential tasks in web corpus construction and web indexing. Boilerplate (redundant and automatically inserted material like menus, copyright notices, navigational elements, etc.) is usually considered to be linguistically unattractive for inclusion in a web corpus. Also, search engines should not index such material because it can lead to spurious results for search terms if these terms appear in boilerplate regions of the web page. In this paper, I present and evaluate a supervised machine-learning approach to general-purpose boilerplate detection for languages based on Latin alphabets using Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs). It is both very efficient and very accurate (between 95 % and \(99\,\%\) correct classifications, depending on the input language). I show that language-specific classifiers greatly improve the accuracy of boilerplate detectors. The single features used for the classification are evaluated with regard to the merit they contribute to the classification. Furthermore, I show that the accuracy of the MLP is on a par with that of a wide range of other classifiers. My approach has been implemented in the open-source texrex web page cleaning software, and large corpora constructed using it are available from the COW initiative, including the CommonCOW corpora created from CommonCrawl datasets.

Mark Stevenson,Language Resources and Evaluation,fact distribution in information extraction,2006,"Several recent Information Extraction (IE) systems have been restricted to the identification facts which are described within a single sentence. It is not clear what effect this has on the difficulty of the extraction task or how the performance of systems which consider only single sentences should be compared with those which consider multiple sentences. This paper compares three IE evaluation corpora, from the Message Understanding Conferences, and finds that a significant proportion of the facts mentioned therein are not described within a single sentence. Therefore systems which are evaluated only on facts described within single sentences are being tested against a limited portion of the relevant information in the text and it is difficult to compare their performance with other systems. Further analysis demonstrates that anaphora resolution and world knowledge are required to combine information described across multiple sentences. This result has implications for the development and evaluation of IE systems."

We then used these measures to automatically extract verb complements from corpora. The result is a wide-coverage, accurate dictionary that lists not only the likely complements for each verb, but also the likelihood of each complement. We evaluated the quality of the extracted dictionary both intrinsically and extrinsically. Intrinsically, we showed high precision and recall on randomly (but systematically) selected verbs. Extrinsically, we showed that using the extracted information is beneficial for two applications, prepositional phrase attachment disambiguation and Arabic-to-Hebrew machine translation."

The corpus targeted 146 ambiguous idioms, and consists of 102,856 examples, each of which is annotated with a literal/idiomatic label. All sentences were collected from the World Wide Web. For idiom identification, 90 out of the 146 idioms were targeted and a word sense disambiguation (WSD) method was adopted using both common WSD features and idiom-specific features. The corpus and the experiment are both, as far as can be determined, the largest of their kinds. It was discovered that a standard supervised WSD method works well for idiom identification and it achieved accuracy levels of 89.25 and 88.86%, with and without idiom-specific features, respectively. It was also found that the most effective idiom-specific feature is the one that involves the adjacency of idiom constituents."
Julie MennesTed PedersenEls Lefever,Language Resources and Evaluation,approaching terminological ambiguity in cross disciplinary communication as a word sense induction task a pilot study,2019,"Cross-disciplinary communication is often impeded by terminological ambiguity. Hence, cross-disciplinary teams would greatly benefit from using a language technology-based tool that allows for the (at least semi-) automated resolution of ambiguous terms. Although no such tool is readily available, an interesting theoretical outline of one does exist. The main obstacle for the concrete realization of this tool is the current lack of an effective method for the automatic detection of the different meanings of ambiguous terms across different disciplinary jargons. In this paper, we set up a pilot study to experimentally assess whether the word sense induction technique of ‘context clustering’, as implemented in the software package ‘SenseClusters’, might be a solution. More specifically, given several sets of sentences coming from a cross-disciplinary corpus containing a specific ambiguous term, we verify whether this technique can classify each sentence in accordance to the meaning of the ambiguous term in that sentence. For the experiments, we first compile a corpus that represents the disciplinary jargons involved in a project on Bone Tissue Engineering. Next, we conduct two series of experiments. The first series focuses on determining appropriate SenseClusters parameter settings using manually selected test data for the ambiguous target terms ‘matrix’ and ‘model’. The second series evaluates the actual performance of SenseClusters using randomly selected test data for an extended set of target terms. We observe that SenseClusters can successfully classify sentences from a cross-disciplinary corpus according to the meaning of the ambiguous term they contain. Hence, we argue that this implementation of context clustering shows potential as a method for the automatic detection of the meanings of ambiguous terms in cross-disciplinary communication."

Aurawan ImsombutAsanee Kawtrakul,Language Resources and Evaluation,automatic building of an ontology on the basis of text corpora in thai,2008,"This paper presents a methodology for automatic learning of ontologies from Thai text corpora, by extraction of terms and relations. A shallow parser is used to chunk texts on which we identify taxonomic relations with the help of cues: lexico-syntactic patterns and item lists. The main advantage of the approach is that it simplify the task of concept and relation labeling since cues help for identifying the ontological concept and hinting their relation. However, these techniques pose certain problems, i.e. cue word ambiguity, item list identification, and numerous candidate terms. We also propose the methodology to solve these problems by using lexicon and co-occurrence features and weighting them with information gain. The precision, recall and F-measure of the system are 0.74, 0.78 and 0.76, respectively."

Our proposal relies on web crawling to automatically acquire parallel data to train statistical MT systems if any such data can be found for the language pair and domain of interest. If that is not the case, we resort to (1) crowdsourcing to translate small amounts of text (hundreds of sentences), which are then used to tune statistical MT models, and (2) web crawling of vast amounts of monolingual data (millions of sentences), which are then used to build language models for MT. We apply these to two respective use-cases for Croatian, an under-resourced language that has gained relevance since it recently attained official 
status in the European Union. The first use-case regards tourism, given the importance of this sector to Croatia’s economy, while the second has to do with tweets, due to the growing importance of social media. For tourism, we crawl parallel data from 20 web domains using two state-of-the-art crawlers and explore how to combine the crawled data with bigger amounts of general-domain data. Our domain-adapted system is evaluated on a set of three additional tourism web domains and it outperforms the baseline in terms of automatic metrics and/or vocabulary coverage. In the social media use-case, we deal with tweets from the 2014 edition of the soccer World Cup. We build domain-adapted systems by (1) translating small amounts of tweets to be used for tuning by means of crowdsourcing and (2) crawling vast amounts of monolingual tweets. These systems outperform the baseline (Microsoft Bing) by 7.94 BLEU points (5.11 TER) for Croatian-to-English and by 2.17 points (1.94 TER) for English-to-Croatian on a test set translated by means of crowdsourcing. A complementary manual analysis sheds further light on these results."
Mahmoud El-HajUdo KruschwitzChris Fox,Language Resources and Evaluation,creating language resources for under resourced languages methodologies and experiments with arabic,2015,"Language resources are important for those working on computational methods to analyse and study languages. These resources are needed to help advancing the research in fields such as natural language processing, machine learning, information retrieval and text analysis in general. We describe the creation of useful resources for languages that currently lack them, taking resources for Arabic summarisation as a case study. We illustrate three different paradigms for creating language resources, namely: (1) using crowdsourcing to produce a small resource rapidly and relatively cheaply; (2) translating an existing gold-standard dataset, which is relatively easy but potentially of lower quality; and (3) using manual effort with appropriately skilled human participants to create a resource that is more expensive but of high quality. The last of these was used as a test collection for TAC-2011. An evaluation of the resources is also presented."
Chao WangGrace ChungStephanie Seneff,Language Resources and Evaluation,automatic induction of language model data for a spoken dialogue system,2006,"In this paper, we address the issue of generating in-domain language model training data when little or no real user data are available. The two-stage approach taken begins with a data induction phase whereby linguistic constructs from out-of-domain sentences are harvested and integrated with artificially constructed in-domain phrases. After some syntactic and semantic filtering, a large corpus of synthetically assembled user utterances is induced. In the second stage, two sampling methods are explored to filter the synthetic corpus to achieve a desired probability distribution of the semantic content, both on the sentence level and on the class level. The first method utilizes user simulation technology, which obtains the probability model via an interplay between a probabilistic user model and the dialogue system. The second method synthesizes novel dialogue interactions from the raw data by modelling after a small set of dialogues produced by the developers during the course of system refinement. Evaluation is conducted on recognition performance in a restaurant information domain. We show that a partial match to usage-appropriate semantic content distribution can be achieved via user simulations. Furthermore, word error rate can be reduced when limited amounts of in-domain training data are augmented with synthetic data derived by our methods."
Marjan Van de KauterBart DesmetVéronique Hoste,Language Resources and Evaluation,the good the bad and the implicit a comprehensive approach to annotating explicit and implicit sentiment,2015,"We present a fine-grained scheme for the annotation of polar sentiment in text, that accounts for explicit sentiment (so-called private states), as well as implicit expressions of sentiment (polar facts). Polar expressions are annotated below sentence level and classified according to their subjectivity status. Additionally, they are linked to one or more targets with a specific polar orientation and intensity. Other components of the annotation scheme include source attribution and the identification and classification of expressions that modify polarity. In previous research, little attention has been given to implicit sentiment, which represents a substantial amount of the polar expressions encountered in our data. An English and Dutch corpus of financial newswire text, consisting of over 45,000 words each, was annotated using our scheme. A subset of this corpus was used to conduct an inter-annotator agreement study, which demonstrated that the proposed scheme can be used to reliably annotate explicit and implicit sentiment in real-world textual data, making the created corpora a useful resource for sentiment analysis."

The results lead us to conclude that SVD makes the extraction less computationally efficient and much less precise than other more basic models for the task of extracting translation equivalents from comparable corpora."

A widely used method is to simply evaluate the degree to which an algorithm can reproduce the same expressions as those in previously collected corpora. Several researchers, however, have noted the need of a task-performance evaluation measuring the effectiveness of a referring expression in the achievement of a given task goal. This is particularly important in collaborative situated dialogues. Using referring expressions used by six pairs of Japanese speakers collaboratively solving Tangram puzzles, we conducted a task-performance evaluation of referring expressions with 36 human evaluators. Particularly we focused on the evaluation of demonstrative pronouns generated by a machine learning-based algorithm. Comparing the results of this task-performance evaluation with the results of a previously conducted corpus-matching evaluation (Spanger et al. in Lang Resour Eval, 2010b), we confirmed the limitation of a corpus-matching evaluation and discuss the need for a task-performance evaluation."

The paper addresses jointly these two issues by analyzing the influence of speech transcription errors on the detection of opinions and business concepts. We present both modules: the speech transcription system, which consists in a successful adaptation of a conversational speech transcription system to call-centre data and the information extraction module, which is based on a semantic modeling of business concepts, opinions and sentiments with complex linguistic rules. Three models of opinions are implemented based on the discourse theory, the appraisal theory and the marketers’ expertise, respectively. The influence of speech recognition errors on the information extraction module is evaluated by comparing its outputs on manual versus automatic transcripts. The F-scores obtained are 0.79 for business concepts detection, 0.74 for opinion detection and 0.67 for the extraction of relations between opinions and their target. This result and the in-depth analysis of the errors show the feasibility of opinion detection based on complex rules on call-centre transcripts."

Fawaz S. Al-anzi,Computers and the Humanities,stochastic models for automatic diacritics generation of arabic names,2004,"In this paper, two new models for generating diacritics for Arabic names are proposed. The first proposed model is called N-gram model. It is a stochastic model that is based on generating a corpus database of N-grams extracted from a large database of names with their corresponding probability according to an N-gram position in a text (Bhal et al., 1983). i.e., the probability that an N-gram has happened in a position x, where x can be the first, second,... or ith position in the text. Replacing the N-grams with their patterns extends the first model to the second proposed stochastic model. It is called the Envelope model. These two proposed models are unique in being the first attempt to solve the problem in Arabic text diacritics generation using linguistic constraints stochastic approaches that are neither grammatical nor pure lexical based (Merialdo, 1991; Ney and Essen, 1991; Schukat-Talamazzini et al., 1992; Witschel and Niedermair, 1992). This methodology helps in reducing size and complexity of software implementation of the proposed models and makes it easier to update and port across different platforms."

We identify a number of critical issues that hamper comparison of the results obtained by different researchers. Some of these issues are common to other NLP-related tasks: e.g., the difficulty of exactly identifying the effects on performance of the data (sample selection and sample size), of the domain theory (features selected), and of algorithm parameter settings. Some issues are specific to IE: how leniently to assess inexact identification of filler boundaries, the possibility of multiple fillers for a slot, and how the counting is performed. We argue that, when specifying an IE task, these issues should be explicitly addressed, and a number of methodological characteristics should be clearly defined. To empirically verify the practical impact of the issues mentioned above, we perform a survey of the results of different algorithms when applied to a few standard datasets. The survey shows a serious lack of consensus on these issues, which makes it difficult to draw firm conclusions on a comparative evaluation of the algorithms. Our aim is to elaborate a clear and detailed experimental methodology and propose it to the IE community. Widespread agreement on this proposal should lead to future IE comparative evaluations that are fair and reliable. To demonstrate the way the methodology is to be applied we have organized and run a comparative evaluation of ML-based IE systems (the Pascal Challenge on ML-based IE) where the principles described in this article are put into practice. In this article we describe the proposed methodology and its motivations. The Pascal evaluation is then described and its results presented."

Simple queries in NXT express variable bindings for n-tuples of objects, optionally constrained by type, and give a set of conditions on the n-tuples combined with boolean operators. The defined operators for the condition tests allow full access to the timing and structural properties of the data model. A complex query facility passes variable bindings from one query to another for filtering, returning a tree structure.

It contains a theoretical component, describing basic methodology and potential obstacles, as well as a practical component, describing an experiment which tests the efficiency of incremental annotation. Apart from guidelines for the execution of such pilot experiments, the experiment demonstrates that incremental annotation is most effective when supported by thorough pre-planning and documentation. Unplanned, opportunistic use of existing annotation is much less effective in its reduction of annotation time and furthermore increases the development time of the annotation software, so that this type of incremental annotation appears only practical for large amounts of heritage data."
Imene BensalemPaolo RossoSalim Chikhi,Language Resources and Evaluation,on the use of character n grams as the only intrinsic evidence of plagiarism,2019,"When a shift in writing style is noticed in a document, doubts arise about its originality. Based on this clue to plagiarism, the intrinsic approach to plagiarism detection identifies the stolen passages by analysing the writing style of the suspicious document without comparing it to textual resources that may serve as sources for the plagiarist. Character n-grams are recognised as a successful approach to modelling text for writing style analysis. Although prior studies have investigated the best practice of using character n-grams in authorship attribution and other problems, there is still a need for such investigations in the context of intrinsic plagiarism detection. Moreover, it has been assumed in previous works that the ways of using character n-grams in authorship attribution remain the same for intrinsic plagiarism detection. In this paper, we study the effect of character n-grams frequency and length on the performance of intrinsic plagiarism detection. Our experiments utilise two state-of-the-art methods and five large document collections of PAN labs written in English and Arabic. We demonstrate empirically that the low- and the high-frequency n-grams are not equally relevant for intrinsic plagiarism detection, but their performance depends on the way they are exploited.

Zeinab RahimiSamira NoferestiMehrnoush Shamsfard,Language Resources and Evaluation,applying data mining and machine learning techniques for sentiment shifter identification,2019,"Sentiment shifters, as a set of words and expressions that can affect text polarity, play a fundamental role in opinion mining. However, the limited ability of current automated opinion mining systems in handling shifters is a major challenge. This paper presents three novel and efficient methods for identifying sentiment shifters in reviews in order to improve the overall accuracy of opinion mining systems: two data mining based algorithms and a machine learning based algorithm. The data mining algorithms do not need shifter tagged datasets. They use weighted association rule mining (WARM) for finding frequent patterns representing sentiment shifters from a domain-specific and a general corpus. These patterns include different kinds of shifter words such as shifter verbs and quantifiers and are able to handle both local and long-distance shifters. The items in WARM for the two designed methods are in the form of dependency relations and SRL arguments of sentences, respectively. Secondly, we implemented a supervised machine learning system based on semantic features of sentences for shifter identification and polarity classification. This method obviously needs shifter tagged dataset for shifter identification. We tested our proposed algorithms on polarity classification task for 2 domains: a specific domain (drug reviews) and a general domain. Experiments demonstrate that (1) the extracted shifters improve the performance of the polarity classification, (2) the proposed data mining methods outperform other implemented methods in shifter identification, and (3) the proposed semantic based machine learning method has the best efficiency among all implemented methods in polarity classification.

To facilitate such investigations, this paper describes a new corpus named the “interactive emotional dyadic motion capture database” (IEMOCAP), collected by the Speech Analysis and Interpretation Laboratory (SAIL) at the University of Southern California (USC). This database was recorded from ten actors in dyadic sessions with markers on the face, head, and hands, which provide detailed information about their facial expressions and hand movements during scripted and spontaneous spoken communication scenarios. The actors performed selected emotional scripts and also improvised hypothetical scenarios designed to elicit specific types of emotions (happiness, anger, sadness, frustration and neutral state).

HaertelDeryle Lonsdale,Language Resources and Evaluation,evaluating machine assisted annotation in under resourced settings,2014,"Machine assistance is vital to managing the cost of corpus annotation projects. Identifying effective forms of machine assistance through principled evaluation is particularly important and challenging in under-resourced domains and highly heterogeneous corpora, as the quality of machine assistance varies. We perform a fine-grained evaluation of two machine-assistance techniques in the context of an under-resourced corpus annotation project. This evaluation requires a carefully controlled user study crafted to test a number of specific hypotheses. We show that human annotators performing morphological analysis of text in a Semitic language perform their task significantly more accurately and quickly when even mediocre pre-annotations are provided. When pre-annotations are at least 70 % accurate, annotator speed and accuracy show statistically significant relative improvements of 25–35 and 5–7 %, respectively. However, controlled user studies are too costly to be suitable for under-resourced corpus annotation projects. Thus, we also present an alternative analysis methodology that models the data as a combination of latent variables in a Bayesian framework. We show that modeling the effects of interesting confounding factors can generate useful insights. In particular, correction propagation appears to be most effective for our task when implemented with minimal user involvement. More importantly, by explicitly accounting for confounding variables, this approach has the potential to yield fine-grained evaluations using data collected in a natural environment outside of costly controlled user studies."

We show that despite the difficulties caused by the variation, we are still able to reach about 95 % accuracy in a tenfold cross-validation experiment for both tagging and lemmatization. We can deal effectively with the variation in tokenization (as applied by the authors) by pre-normalization (retokenization). For variation in spelling, however, we choose to expand our lexicon with predicted spelling variants. For those forms which can also not be found in this expanded lexicon, we first derive the word class and subsequently search for the most similar lexicon word. Interestingly, our techniques for recognizing spelling variants turn out to be vital for lemmatization accuracy, but much less important for tagging accuracy."

In particular, automatically computed alignments with higher precision or higher recall can be favoured depending on the value of this ratio.

Hang Su,Language Resources and Evaluation,how products are evaluated evaluation in customer review texts,2016,"This study, drawing on insights from the Appraisal framework, the parameter-based approach to evaluation and corpus linguistics, investigates the evaluative language used in customer review texts. The primary goal of this investigation is to develop a framework of evaluation that can be used to account adequately for evaluative expressions in customer review texts, and the ultimate goal is to support the argument that the modelling and theorising of evaluation is context-specific. Based on the investigation into a corpus compiled of review texts retrieved from www.amazon.co.uk, this study proposes a data-driven, parameter-based and appraisal-informed framework of evaluation which comprises four parameters—Quality, Satisfactoriness, Recommendability and Worthiness. Since these parameters are not thought-up, but are generalised from real data, it is arguable that the proposed framework of evaluation is certainly valid and thus can be used to describe and analyse evaluative language used in this particular context. This in turn indicates that the description and theorising of evaluation is indeed highly dependent on the discourse type that is under examination."

Helmer StrikMicha HulsboschCatia Cucchiarini,Language Resources and Evaluation,analyzing and identifying multiword expressions in spoken language,2010,"The present paper investigates multiword expressions (MWEs) in spoken language and possible ways of identifying MWEs automatically in speech corpora. Two MWEs that emerged from previous studies and that occur frequently in Dutch are analyzed to study their pronunciation characteristics and compare them to those of other utterances in a large speech corpus. The analyses reveal that these MWEs display extreme pronunciation variation and reduction, i.e., many phonemes and even syllables are deleted. Several measures of pronunciation reduction are calculated for these two MWEs and for all other utterances in the corpus. Five of these measures are more than twice as high for the MWEs, thus indicating considerable reduction. One overall measure of pronunciation deviation is then calculated and used to automatically identify MWEs in a large speech corpus. The results show that neither this overall measure, nor frequency of co-occurrence alone are suitable for identifying MWEs. The best results are obtained by using a metric that combines overall pronunciation reduction with weighted frequency. In this way, recurring “islands of pronunciation reduction” that contain (potential) MWEs can be identified in a large speech corpus."

The primary objective was for a group oflexicographers to manually examine keywords in a largenumber of corpus contexts, and assign to each contexta sense-tag for the keyword, taken from the Hectordictionary. Corpus contexts also had to be manuallypart-of-speech (POS) tagged. Various observationsmade and insights gained by the lexicographers duringthis process will be presented, including a critiqueof the resources and the methodology."
Janne Bondi Johannessen,Computers and the Humanities,tagging and the case of pronouns,1998,"Using a corpus to investigate empirically grammatical phenomena prior to writing grammatical rules or constraints for a disambiguating tagger is important. The paper shows how even case distinctions on pronouns are used more diversely than is usually assumed. Both in English and Norwegian nominative pronouns are used in more positions than the expected Subject one. Although the other uses are statistically less frequent, they may be important to the users of the resulting tagged corpus – who are often theoretical linguists. A tagger should therefore tag correctly also the more infrequent constructions. The paper shows how this can be done in a Constraint Grammar type tagger."
Silke Scheible,Language Resources and Evaluation,textwiki a superlative resource,2012,"Although superlatives are commonly used in natural language, so far there has been no large-scale computational investigation of the types of comparisons they express. This article describes a comprehensive annotation scheme for superlatives, which classifies superlatives according to their surface forms and motivates an initial focus on so-called “ISA superlatives”. This type of superlative comparison is especially suitable for a computational approach because both their targets and comparison sets are explicitly realised in the text, and the proposed annotation scheme offers guidelines for annotating the spans of such comparative elements. The annotations are tested and evaluated on 500 tokens of superlatives with good inter-annotator agreement. In addition to providing a platform for investigating superlatives on a larger scale, this research also introduces a new text-based Wikipedia corpus in which all superlative instances have been annotated according to the proposed annotation scheme, and which has been used to develop a tool that can reliably distinguish between different superlative types, and identify the comparative components of ISA superlatives."
Stefan BottHoracio Saggion,Language Resources and Evaluation,text simplification resources for spanish,2014,"In this paper we present the development of a text simplification system for Spanish. Text simplification is the adaptation of a text for the special needs of certain groups of readers, such as language learners, people with cognitive difficulties, and elderly people, among others. There is a clear need for simplified texts, but manual production and adaptation of existing text is labour-intensive and costly. Automatic simplification is a field which attracts growing attention in Natural Language Processing, but, to the best of our knowledge, there are no existing simplification tools for Spanish. We present a corpus study which aims to identify the operations a text simplification system needs to carry out in order to produce an output similar to what human editors produce when they simplify news texts. We also present a first prototype for automatic simplification, which shows that the most important simplification operations can be successfully treated."
Marianna ApidianakiBenoît Sagot,Language Resources and Evaluation,data driven synset induction and disambiguation for wordnet development,2014,"Automatic methods for wordnet development in languages other than English generally exploit information found in Princeton WordNet (PWN) and translations extracted from parallel corpora. A common approach consists in preserving the structure of PWN and transferring its content in new languages using alignments, possibly combined with information extracted from multilingual semantic resources. Even if the role of PWN remains central in this process, these automatic methods offer an alternative to the manual elaboration of new wordnets. However, their limited coverage has a strong impact on that of the resulting resources. Following this line of research, we apply a cross-lingual word sense disambiguation method to wordnet development. Our approach exploits the output of a data-driven sense induction method that generates sense clusters in new languages, similar to wordnet synsets, by identifying word senses and relations in parallel corpora. We apply our cross-lingual word sense disambiguation method to the task of enriching a French wordnet resource, the WOLF, and show how it can be efficiently used for increasing its coverage. Although our experiments involve the English–French language pair, the proposed methodology is general enough to be applied to the development of wordnet resources in other languages for which parallel corpora are available. Finally, we show how the disambiguation output can serve to reduce the granularity of new wordnets and the degree of polysemy present in PWN."

 The involvement of non-expert users is especially critical for under-resourced languages which either lack or cannot afford the recruitment of a skilled workforce. Adding a word to a morphological dictionary usually requires identifying its stem along with the inflection paradigm that can be used in order to generate all the word forms of the new entry. Our method works under the assumption that the average speakers of a language can successfully answer the polar question “is x a valid form of the word w to be inserted?”, where x represents tentative alternative (inflected) forms of the new word w. The experiments show that with a small number of polar questions the correct stem and paradigm can be obtained from non-experts with high success rates. We study the impact of different heuristic and probabilistic approaches on the actual number of questions."
Christian Delcourt,Computers and the Humanities,where have all the key words gone,1989,"A key word with regard to a sub-corpus is a word of which the frequency in that sub-corpus is significantly higher than expected under the hypothesis that its use and the variable “part of the corpus” are mutually independent. A study in literary statistics almost invariably includes a chapter devoted to key words. However, a strong attack has been recently launched upon the way stylometry has been modelling texts since the classical works of Herdan, Guiraud or Muller. In fact statistical modelling seems as valid in stylistics as in any other field of the humanities and social sciences. What is questionable is the fact that many studies in literary statistics are more satisfied with the easy identification of monsters, i.e. literary phenomena unexplained by wrong models, than with the laborious research of models fitting the textual data well. A short examination of the mentioned controversy and the quantitative analysis of an example provided by Laclos' novelLes Liaisons dangereuses endeavour to support this argument."

Application of these models to frequency distributions of a text, a corpus and morphological data reveals that no model can lay claim to exclusive validity, while inspection of the extrapolated theoretical vocabulary sizes raises doubts as to whether the urn scheme with independent trials is the correct underlying model for word frequency data. The role of morphology in shaping word frequency distributions is discussed, as well as parallelisms between vocabulary richness in literary studies and morphological productivity in linguistics."

Since linguistics information on Philippine languages are available, but as of yet, the focus has been on theoretical linguistics and little is done on the computational aspects of these languages, attempts are reported here on the manual construction of these language resources such as the grammar, lexicon, morphological information, and the corpora which were literally built from almost non-existent digital forms. Due to the inherent difficulties of manual construction, we also discuss our experiments on various technologies for automatic extraction of these resources to handle the intricacies of the Filipino language, designed with the intention of using them for the MT system. To implement the different MT engines and to ensure the improvement of translation quality, other language tools (such as the morphological analyzer and generator, and the part of speech tagger) were developed."

However, many languages still lack treebanks and building a treebank can be very complicated and difficult. This work has a twofold objective. Firstly, to share our results in constructing a large Vietnamese treebank (VTB) with three levels of annotation including word segmentation, part-of-speech tagging, and syntactic analysis. Major steps in the treebank construction process are described with particular regard to specific Vietnamese properties such as lack of word delimiter and isolation. Those properties make sentences highly syntactically ambiguous, and therefore it is difficult to ensure a high level of agreement among annotators. Various studies of Vietnamese syntax were employed not only to define annotations but also to systematically deal with ambiguities. Annotators were supported by automatic labelling tools, which are based on statistical machine learning methods, for sentence pre-processing and a tree editor for supporting manual annotation. As a result, an annotation agreement of around 90 % was achieved. Our second objective is to present our method for automatically finding errors and inconsistencies in treebank corpora and its application to the construction of the VTB. This method employs the Shannon entropy measure in a manner that the more reduced entropy the more corrected errors in a treebank. The method ranks error candidates by using a scoring function based on conditional entropy. Our experiments showed that this method detected high-error-density subsets of original error candidate sets, and that the corpus entropy was significantly reduced after error correction. The size of these subsets was only about one third of the whole set, while these subsets contained 80–90 % of the total errors. This method can also be applied to languages similar to Vietnamese."
Helena Medeiros de CaseliCarlos RamischMaria das Graças Volpe NunesAline Villavicencio,Language Resources and Evaluation,alignment based extraction of multiword expressions,2010,"Due to idiosyncrasies in their syntax, semantics or frequency, Multiword Expressions (MWEs) have received special attention from the NLP community, as the methods and techniques developed for the treatment of simplex words are not necessarily suitable for them. This is certainly the case for the automatic acquisition of MWEs from corpora. A lot of effort has been directed to the task of automatically identifying them, with considerable success. In this paper, we propose an approach for the identification of MWEs in a multilingual context, as a by-product of a word alignment process, that not only deals with the identification of possible MWE candidates, but also associates some multiword expressions with semantics. The results obtained indicate the feasibility and low costs in terms of tools and resources demanded by this approach, which could, for example, facilitate and speed up lexicographic work."

The approach, which we apply here to Slovene, takes into account monosemous and polysemous words, general and specialised vocabulary as well as simple and multi-word lexemes. The extracted words are then assigned one or several synset ids, based on a classifier that relies on several features including distributional similarity. Finally, we identify and remove highly dubious (literal, synset) pairs, based on simple distributional information extracted from a large corpus in an unsupervised way. Automatic, manual and task-based evaluations show that the resulting resource, the latest version of the Slovene wordnet, is already a valuable source of lexico-semantic information."

 To perform an adequate evaluation is of great relevance to ensure that automatic summaries can be useful for the context and/or application they are generated for.
 To this end, researchers must be aware of the evaluation metrics, approaches, and datasets that are available, in order to decide which of them would be the most suitable to use, or to be able to propose new ones, overcoming the possible limitations that existing methods may present. In this article, a critical and historical analysis of evaluation metrics, methods, and datasets for automatic summarization systems is presented, where the strengths and weaknesses of evaluation efforts are discussed and the major challenges to solve are identified. Therefore, a clear up-to-date overview of the evolution and progress of summarization evaluation is provided, giving the reader useful insights into the past, present and latest trends in the automatic evaluation of summaries."

The low frequency and the variability of the syntactic structures of MWTs in the source and the target languages are the main reported problems. This paper defines a general framework dedicated to the lexical alignment of MWTs from comparable corpora that includes a compositional translation process and the standard lexical context analysis. The compositional method which is based on the translation of lexical items being restrictive, we introduce an extended compositional method that bridges the gap between MWTs of different syntactic structures through morphological links. We experimented with the two compositional methods for the French–Japanese alignment task. The results show a significant improvement for the translation of MWTs and advocate further morphological analysis in lexical alignment."

The ability to geo-locate events in textual reports represents a valuable source of information in many real-world applications such as emergency responses, real-time social media geographical event analysis, understanding location instructions in auto-response systems and more. However, geoparsing is still widely regarded as a challenge because of domain language diversity, place name ambiguity, metonymic language and limited leveraging of context as we show in our analysis. Results to date, whilst promising, are on laboratory data and unlike in wider NLP are often not cross-compared. In this study, we evaluate and analyse the performance of a number of leading geoparsers on a number of corpora and highlight the challenges in detail. We also publish an automatically geotagged Wikipedia corpus to alleviate the dearth of (open source) corpora in this domain.

Marta R. Costa-jussàJosé A. R. FonollosaEnric Monte,Language Resources and Evaluation,recursive alignment block classification technique for word reordering in statistical machine translation,2011,"Statistical machine translation (SMT) is based on alignment models which learn from bilingual corpora the word correspondences between source and target language. These models are assumed to be capable of learning reorderings. However, the difference in word order between two languages is one of the most important sources of errors in SMT. In this paper, we show that SMT can take advantage of inductive learning in order to solve reordering problems. Given a word alignment, we identify those pairs of consecutive source blocks (sequences of words) whose translation is swapped, i.e. those blocks which, if swapped, generate a correct monotonic translation. Afterwards, we classify these pairs into groups, following recursively a co-occurrence block criterion, in order to infer reorderings. Inside the same group, we allow new internal combination in order to generalize the reorder to unseen pairs of blocks. Then, we identify the pairs of blocks in the source corpora (both training and test) which belong to the same group. We swap them and we use the modified source training corpora to realign and to build the final translation system. We have evaluated our reordering approach both in alignment and translation quality. In addition, we have used two state-of-the-art SMT systems: a Phrased-based and an Ngram-based. Experiments are reported on the EuroParl task, showing improvements almost over 1 point in the standard MT evaluation metrics (mWER and BLEU)."

Hahn Koo,Language Resources and Evaluation,an unsupervised method for identifying loanwords in korean,2015,"This paper presents an unsupervised method for developing a character-based n-gram classifier that identifies loanwords or transliterated foreign words in Korean text. The classifier is trained on an unlabeled corpus using the Expectation Maximization algorithm, building on seed words extracted from the corpus. Words with high token frequency serve as native seed words. Words with seeming traces of vowel insertion to repair consonant clusters serve as foreign seed words. What counts as a trace of insertion is determined using phoneme co-occurrence statistics in conjunction with ideas and findings in phonology. Experiments show that the method can produce an unsupervised classifier that performs at a level comparable to that of a supervised classifier. In a cross-validation experiment using a corpus of about 9.2 million words and a lexicon of about 71,000 words, mean F-scores of the best unsupervised classifier and the corresponding supervised classifier were 94.77 and 96.67 %, respectively. Experiments also suggest that the method can be readily applied to other languages with similar phonotactics such as Japanese."
Estela SaqueteJames Pustejovsky,Language Resources and Evaluation,automatic transformation from tides to timeml annotation,2011,"Until recently, most systems performing temporal extraction and reasoning from text have focused on recognizing and normalizing temporal expressions alone, for which the TIDES annotation scheme has been adopted. Temporal awareness of a text, however, involves not only identifying the temporal expressions, but the events which these expressions anchor, as well as other events which must be ordered relative to them. Because of these broader concerns, TimeML has been developed as an annotation specification that encompasses not only temporal expressions, but all temporally relevant aspects of a text. The annotation schemes, however, are not interchangeable, resulting in incompatible corpora and accompanying extraction algorithms for each standard. In this paper, we describe an automatic migration process from the  TIMEX2  tags of TIDES to the  TIMEX3  tags of TimeML. This transformation procedure has been implemented and evaluated with two different corpora, obtaining 93.3 and 89.2% overall F-Measure respectively."

Diana McCarthyRavi SinhaRada Mihalcea,Language Resources and Evaluation,the cross lingual lexical substitution task,2013,"In this paper we provide an account of the cross-lingual lexical substitution task run as part of SemEval-2010. In this task both annotators (native Spanish speakers, proficient in English) and participating systems had to find Spanish translations for target words in the context of an English sentence. Because only translations of a single lexical unit were required, this task does not necessitate a full blown translation system. This we hope encouraged those working specifically on lexical semantics to participate without a requirement for them to use machine translation software, though they were free to use whatever resources they chose. In this paper we pay particular attention to the resources used by the various participating systems and present analyses to demonstrate the relative strengths of the systems as well as the requirements they have in terms of resources. In addition to the analyses of individual systems we also present the results of a combined system based on voting from the individual systems. We demonstrate that the system produces better results at finding the most frequent translation from the annotators compared to the highest ranked translation provided by individual systems. This supports our other analyses that the systems are heterogeneous, with different strengths and weaknesses."

Second, we compare our statistics with qualitative comments in the New Testament research literature, and extend them to cover the entirety of the Gospels. Most significantly, we gauge the feasibility of applying our approach to other literary works, by measuring the amount of errors that would be introduced by automatically identified dialogues, speakers and listeners."

Turkish presents an interesting problem for statistical models as the potential tag set size is very large because of the productive derivational morphology. We propose to handle this by breaking up the morhosyntactic tags into inflectional groups, each of which contains the inflectional features for each (intermediate) derived form. Our statistical models score the probability of each morhosyntactic tag by considering statistics over the individual inflectional groups and surface roots in trigram models. Among the four models that we have developed and tested, the simplest model ignoring the local morphotactics within words performs the best. Our best trigram model performs with 93.95% accuracy on our test data getting all the morhosyntactic and semantic features correct. If we are just interested in syntactically relevant features and ignore a very small set of semantic features, then the accuracy increases to 95.07%."

Milan GrittaMohammad Taher PilehvarNigel Collier,Language Resources and Evaluation,a pragmatic guide to geoparsing evaluation,2019,"Empirical methods in geoparsing have thus far lacked a standard evaluation framework describing the task, metrics and data used to compare state-of-the-art systems. Evaluation is further made inconsistent, even unrepresentative of real world usage by the lack of distinction between the different types of toponyms, which necessitates new guidelines, a consolidation of metrics and a detailed toponym taxonomy with implications for Named Entity Recognition (NER) and beyond. To address these deficiencies, our manuscript introduces a new framework in three parts. (Part 1) Task Definition: clarified via corpus linguistic analysis proposing a fine-grained Pragmatic Taxonomy of Toponyms. (Part 2) Metrics: discussed and reviewed for a rigorous evaluation including recommendations for NER/Geoparsing practitioners. (Part 3) Evaluation data: shared via a new dataset called GeoWebNews to provide test/train examples and enable immediate use of our contributions. In addition to fine-grained Geotagging and Toponym Resolution (Geocoding), this dataset is also suitable for prototyping and evaluating machine learning NLP models."

Tree-diagrams implemented by means of suitable computer programs can be of considerable assistance in achieving a cohesive representation of the data. This paper discusses the respective merits of the two main approaches to tree representation and introduces a new method based on the use of unrooted trees. After a detailed examination of the topological properties of such trees, two algorithms are described. The second part of the paper consists in practical applications of the method of tree representation to a corpus of contemporary English poetry. Several sets of data made up of both lexical and grammatical items (adjectives, modals, auxiliaries and personal pronouns) have been submitted to the method. The findings are assessed in terms of their heuristic value in the light of modern linguistic theory and compared with the results obtained by means of more traditional statistical procedures."

It has been exploited in a range of natural language processing applications and has inspired the development of framenets for many languages. We present a methodological approach to the extraction and generation of a computational multilingual FrameNet-based grammar and lexicon. The approach leverages FrameNet-annotated corpora to automatically extract a set of cross-lingual semantico-syntactic valence patterns. Based on data from Berkeley FrameNet and Swedish FrameNet, the proposed approach has been implemented in Grammatical Framework (GF), a categorial grammar formalism specialized for multilingual grammars. The implementation of the grammar and lexicon is supported by the design of FrameNet, providing a frame semantic abstraction layer, an interlingual semantic application programming interface (API), over the interlingual syntactic API already provided by GF Resource Grammar Library. The evaluation of the acquired grammar and lexicon shows the feasibility of the approach. Additionally, we illustrate how the FrameNet-based grammar and lexicon are exploited in two distinct multilingual controlled natural language applications. The produced resources are available under an open source license."

However, three main issues remain still unresolved: (1) distinction of similar languages, (2) detection of multilingualism in a single document, and (3) identifying the language of short texts. In this paper, we describe our work on the development of a benchmark to encourage further research in these three directions, set forth an evaluation framework suitable for the task, and make a dataset of annotated tweets publicly available for research purposes. We also describe the shared task we organized to validate and assess the evaluation framework and dataset with systems submitted by seven different participants, and analyze the performance of these systems. The evaluation of the results submitted by the participants of the shared task helped us shed some light on the shortcomings of state-of-the-art language identification systems, and gives insight into the extent to which the brevity, multilingualism, and language similarity found in texts exacerbate the performance of language identifiers. Our dataset with nearly 35,000 tweets and the evaluation framework provide researchers and practitioners with suitable resources to further study the aforementioned issues on language identification within a common setting that enables to compare results with one another."
Stijn De BeugherGeert BrôneToon Goedemé,Language Resources and Evaluation,a semi automatic annotation tool for unobtrusive gesture analysis,2018,"In a variety of research fields, including linguistics, human–computer interaction research, psychology, sociology and behavioral studies, there is a growing interest in the role of gestural behavior related to speech and other modalities. The analysis of multimodal communication requires high-quality video data and detailed annotation of the different semiotic resources under scrutiny. In the majority of cases, the annotation of hand position, hand motion, gesture type, etc. is done manually, which is a time-consuming enterprise requiring multiple annotators and substantial resources. In this paper we present a semi-automatic alternative, in which the focus lies on minimizing the manual workload while guaranteeing highly accurate annotations. First, we discuss our approach, which consists of several processing steps such as identifying the hands in images, calculating motion of the hands, segmenting the recording in gesture and non-gesture events, etc. Second, we validate our approach against existing corpora in terms of accuracy and usefulness. The proposed approach is designed to provide annotations according to the McNeill (Hand and mind: what gestures reveal about thought, University of Chicago Press, Chicago, 1992) gesture space and the output is compatible with annotation tools such as ELAN or ANVIL."

In this setting, a suspicious document is given, and the task is to retrieve all sections from the document that originate from a large, multilingual document collection. Our contributions in this field are as follows: (1) a comprehensive retrieval process for cross-language plagiarism detection is introduced, highlighting the differences to monolingual plagiarism detection, (2) state-of-the-art solutions for two important subtasks are reviewed, (3) retrieval models for the assessment of cross-language similarity are surveyed, and, (4) the three models CL-CNG, CL-ESA and CL-ASA are compared. Our evaluation is of realistic scale: it relies on 120,000 test documents which are selected from the corpora JRC-Acquis and Wikipedia, so that for each test document highly similar documents are available in all of the six languages English, German, Spanish, French, Dutch, and Polish. The models are employed in a series of ranking tasks, and more than 100 million similarities are computed with each model. The results of our evaluation indicate that CL-CNG, despite its simple approach, is the best choice to rank and compare texts across languages if they are syntactically related. CL-ESA almost matches the performance of CL-CNG, but on arbitrary pairs of languages. CL-ASA works best on “exact” translations but does not generalize well."

The same problem exists also in other language technology applications such as machine translation, information retrieval, and in some extent also in other morphologically rich languages. In this paper we present methods and evaluations in four recent language modeling topics: selecting conversational data from the Internet, adapting models for foreign words, multi-domain and adapted neural network language modeling, and decoding with subword units.

This article presents a comparison of different Word Sense Induction (wsi) clustering algorithms on two novel pseudoword data sets of semantic-similarity and co-occurrence-based word graphs, with a special focus on the detection of homonymic polysemy. We follow the original definition of a pseudoword as the combination of two monosemous terms and their contexts to simulate a polysemous word. The evaluation is performed comparing the algorithm’s output on a pseudoword’s ego word graph (i.e., a graph that represents the pseudoword’s context in the corpus) with the known subdivision given by the components corresponding to the monosemous source words forming the pseudoword. The main contribution of this article is to present a self-sufficient pseudoword-based evaluation framework for wsi graph-based clustering algorithms, thereby defining a new evaluation measure (top2) and a secondary clustering process (hyperclustering). To our knowledge, we are the first to conduct and discuss a large-scale systematic pseudoword evaluation targeting the induction of coarse-grained homonymous word senses across a large number of graph clustering algorithms."

It describes the theoretical as well as practical problems that are encountered when reusing a conventional dictionary for compiling a lexical-semantic resource in terms of a wordnet. More specifically, it describes the methodological issues of compiling a wordnet for Danish, DanNet, from a monolingual basis, and not—as is often seen—by applying the translational expansion method with Princeton WordNet as the English source. Thus, we apply as our basis a large, corpus-based printed dictionary of modern Danish. Using this approach, we discuss the issues of readjusting inconsistent and/or underspecified hyponymy hierarchies taken from the conventional dictionary, sense distinctions as opposed to the synonym sets of wordnets, generating semantic wordnet relations on the basis of sense definitions, and finally, supplementing missing or implicit information."
Dimitrios PritsosEfstathios Stamatatos,Language Resources and Evaluation,open set evaluation of web genre identification,2018,"Web genre detection is a task that can enhance information retrieval systems by providing rich descriptions of documents and enabling more specialized queries. Most of previous studies in this field adopt the closed-set scenario where a given palette comprises all available genre labels. However this is not a realistic setup since web genres are constantly enriched with new labels and existing web genres are evolving in time. Open-set classification, where some pages used in the evaluation phase do not belong to any of the known genres, is a more realistic setup for this task. In this case, all pages not belonging to known genres can be seen as noise. This paper focuses on systematic evaluation of open-set web genre identification when the noise is either structured or unstructured. Two open-set methods combined with alternative text representation schemes and similarity measures are tested based on two benchmark corpora. Moreover, we adopt the openness test for web genre identification that enables the observation of effectiveness for a varying number of known/unknown labels."
Thomas LavergneTanguy UrvoyFrançois Yvon,Language Resources and Evaluation,filtering artificial texts with statistical machine learning techniques,2011,"Fake content is flourishing on the Internet, ranging from basic random word salads to web scraping. Most of this fake content is generated for the purpose of nourishing fake web sites aimed at biasing search engine indexes: at the scale of a search engine, using automatically generated texts render such sites harder to detect than using copies of existing pages. In this paper, we present three methods aimed at distinguishing natural texts from artificially generated ones: the first method uses basic lexicometric features, the second one uses standard language models and the third one is based on a relative entropy measure which captures short range dependencies between words. Our experiments show that lexicometric features and language models are efficient to detect most generated texts, but fail to detect texts that are generated with high order Markov models. By comparison our relative entropy scoring algorithm, especially when trained on a large corpus, allows us to detect these “hard” text generators with a high degree of accuracy."

The best known format for an IGT is the one found in linguistic publications, where one line of text is followed by one line of glosses and one line of free translation. Although used in different functions, IGTs are ubiquitous in linguistic research and publications. Yet they also have been criticised for being fabricated and unreliable in some of their uses. However that might be, IGTs represent linguistic knowledge, and in particular for less-resourced languages, they are not rarely the only structured data available. Under the auspices of the Digital Humanities, linguists increasingly focus on the advantages of Semantic Web technologies. Presenting the modules and procedures of the web-based linguistic application TypeCraft (TC), we outline how the creation of IGTs can become an integral part of a shared linguistic methodology. Linguistic services have the potential of allowing efficient data management, and their strength lies in facilitating new forms of collaboration beyond social networking. They pave the way towards what one might call shared methodologies. In this paper we would like to discuss the linguistic value of web-based technology. By presenting the functionalities of TC and giving a detailed summary of online linguistic data creation and retrieval, we will present external and internal criteria for a single system evaluation of TC centred on usage objectives."
Chris Biemann,Language Resources and Evaluation,creating a system for lexical substitutions from scratch using crowdsourcing,2013,"This article describes the creation and application of the Turk Bootstrap Word Sense Inventory for 397 frequent nouns, which is a publicly available resource for lexical substitution. This resource was acquired using Amazon Mechanical Turk. In a bootstrapping process with massive collaborative input, substitutions for target words in context are elicited and clustered by sense; then, more contexts are collected. Contexts that cannot be assigned to a current target word’s sense inventory re-enter the bootstrapping loop and get a supply of substitutions. This process yields a sense inventory with its granularity determined by substitutions as opposed to psychologically motivated concepts. It comes with a large number of sense-annotated target word contexts. Evaluation on data quality shows that the process is robust against noise from the crowd, produces a less fine-grained inventory than WordNet and provides a rich body of high precision substitution data at low cost. Using the data to train a system for lexical substitutions, we show that amount and quality of the data is sufficient for producing high quality substitutions automatically. In this system, co-occurrence cluster features are employed as a means to cheaply model topicality."

Josef RuppenhoferRussell Lee-GoldmanCaroline SporlederRoser Morante,Language Resources and Evaluation,beyond sentence level semantic role labeling linking argument structures in discourse,2013,"Semantic role labeling is traditionally viewed as a sentence-level task concerned with identifying semantic arguments that are overtly realized in a fairly local context (i.e., a clause or sentence). However, this local view potentially misses important information that can only be recovered if local argument structures are linked across sentence boundaries.

We provide an extended analysis of the results focusing on the impact of evaluation metrics, application scenarios and the methods and features used by the participants. We conclude that additional research is required to be able to leverage syntactic dependency features and external semantic resources for this task, possibly due to limited coverage of scientific domains in existing resources.

Christophe Van BaelHenk van den HeuvelHelmer Strik,Language Resources and Evaluation,validation of phonetic transcriptions in the context of automatic speech recognition,2007,"Some of the speech databases and large spoken language corpora that have been collected during the last fifteen years have been (at least partly) annotated with a broad phonetic transcription. Such phonetic transcriptions are often validated in terms of their resemblance to a handcrafted reference transcription. However, there are at least two methodological issues questioning this validation method. First, no reference transcription can fully represent the phonetic truth. This calls into question the status of such a transcription as a single reference for the quality of other phonetic transcriptions. Second, phonetic transcriptions are often generated to serve various purposes, none of which are considered when the transcriptions are compared to a reference transcription that was not made with the same purpose in mind. Since phonetic transcriptions are often used for the development of automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems, and since the relationship between ASR performance and a transcription’s resemblance to a reference transcription does not seem to be straightforward, we verified whether phonetic transcriptions that are to be used for ASR development can be justifiably validated in terms of their similarity to a purpose-independent reference transcription. To this end, we validated canonical representations and manually verified broad phonetic transcriptions of read speech and spontaneous telephone dialogues in terms of their resemblance to a handcrafted reference transcription on the one hand, and in terms of their suitability for ASR development on the other hand. Whereas the manually verified phonetic transcriptions resembled the reference transcription much closer than the canonical representations, the use of both transcription types yielded similar recognition results. The difference between the outcomes of the two validation methods has two implications. First, ASR developers can save themselves the effort of collecting expensive reference transcriptions in order to validate phonetic transcriptions of speech databases or spoken language corpora. Second, phonetic transcriptions should preferably be validated in terms of the application they will serve because a higher resemblance to a purpose-independent reference transcription is no guarantee for a transcription to be better suited for ASR development."
Ryan GeorgiFei XiaWilliam D. Lewis,Language Resources and Evaluation,capturing divergence in dependency trees to improve syntactic projection,2014,"Obtaining syntactic parses is an important step in many NLP pipelines. However, most of the world’s languages do not have a large amount of syntactically annotated data available for building parsers. Syntactic projection techniques attempt to address this issue by using parallel corpora consisting of resource-poor and resource-rich language pairs, taking advantage of a parser for the resource-rich language and word alignment between the languages to project the parses onto the data for the resource-poor language. These projection methods can suffer, however, when syntactic structures for some sentence pairs in the two languages look quite different. In this paper, we investigate the use of small, parallel, annotated corpora to automatically detect divergent structural patterns between two languages. We then use these detected patterns to improve projection algorithms and dependency parsers, allowing for better performing NLP tools for resource-poor languages, particularly those that may not have large amounts of annotated data necessary for traditional, fully-supervised methods. While this detection process is not exhaustive, we demonstrate that common patterns of divergence can be identified automatically without prior knowledge of a given language pair, and the patterns can be used to improve performance of syntactic projection and parsing."

Fabian BarteldChris BiemannHeike Zinsmeister,Language Resources and Evaluation,token based spelling variant detection in middle low german texts,2019,"In this paper we present a pipeline for the detection of spelling variants, i.e., different spellings that represent the same word, in non-standard texts. For example, in Middle Low German texts in and ihn (among others) are potential spellings of a single word, the personal pronoun ‘him’. Spelling variation is usually addressed by normalization, in which non-standard variants are mapped to a corresponding standard variant, e.g. the Modern German word ihn in the case of in. However, the approach to spelling variant detection presented here does not need such a reference to a standard variant and can therefore be applied to data for which a standard variant is missing.
 The pipeline we present first generates spelling variants for a given word using rewrite rules and surface similarity. Afterwards, the generated types are filtered. We present a new filter that works on the token level, i.e., taking the context of a word into account. Through this mechanism ambiguities on the type level can be resolved. For instance, the Middle Low German word in can not only be the personal pronoun ‘him’, but also the preposition ‘in’, and each of these has different variants. The detected spelling variants can be used in two settings for Digital Humanities research: On the one hand, they can be used to facilitate searching in non-standard texts. On the other hand, they can be used to improve the performance of natural language processing tools on the data by reducing the number of unknown words.
 To evaluate the utility of the pipeline in both applications, we present two evaluation settings and evaluate the pipeline on Middle Low German texts. We were able to improve the F1 score compared with previous work from \(0.39\) to \(0.52\) for the search setting and from \(0.23\) to \(0.30\) when detecting spelling variants of unknown words."
A. GuenocheA. Hesnard,Computers and the Humanities,typologie damphores romaines par une methode logique de classification,1983,"For classifying wine amphoras used at the end of the Roman Republic and the beginning of the Empire (the so-called Dressel 2–4), we present a typological approach which combines a classification algorithm with the archeological reasoning. At the first step, clusters contain only nuclei based on the different production areas. To assign a corpus of artifacts to them, it is divided for each cluster into a context (artifacts which certainly do not belong to the cluster) and a residue. For each cluster, we built characteristic definitions with logical discriminant function of morphological attributes. Each definition cuts the residue in two classes: one containing the artifacts assigned to the cluster by the definition and the complementary one in the residue. Assignment and choices of cluster definitions and context remain with the archeological expert, who submits those typological constructions to a validation process founded on archeological knowledge. Such an approach focuses on a very common situation in human sciences: the construction of a cognitive typology beginning with a partially clustered set. Clustering must be done with descriptive attributes, without knowing if they can be connected with the wanted cluster."

Kevin P. Scannell,Language Resources and Evaluation,statistical unicodification of african languages,2011,"Many languages in Africa are written using Latin-based scripts, but often with extra diacritics (e.g. dots below in Igbo: \({\d i}, {\d o}, {\d u}\)) or modifications to the letters themselves (e.g. open vowels “e” and “o” in Lingala: ɛ, ɔ). While it is possible to render these characters accurately in Unicode, oftentimes keyboard input methods are not easily accessible or are cumbersome to use, and so the vast majority of electronic texts in many African languages are written in plain ASCII. We call the process of converting an ASCII text to its proper Unicode form unicodification. This paper describes an open-source package which performs automatic unicodification, implementing a variant of an algorithm described in previous work of De Pauw, Wagacha, and de Schryver. We have trained models for more than 100 languages using web data, and have evaluated each language using a range of feature sets."

Multilingual porting of SLS demands significant manual effort and language resources, as this manual annotation has to be replicated. Crowdsourcing is an accessible and cost-effective alternative to traditional methods of collecting and annotating data.
 The application of crowdsourcing to simple tasks has been well investigated. However, complex tasks, like cross-language semantic annotation transfer, may generate low judgment agreement and/or poor performance. The most serious issue in cross-language porting is the absence of reference annotations in the target language; thus, crowd quality control and the evaluation of the collected annotations is difficult. In this paper we investigate targeted crowdsourcing for semantic annotation transfer that delegates to crowds a complex task such as segmenting and labeling of concepts taken from a domain ontology; and evaluation using source language annotation. To test the applicability and effectiveness of the crowdsourced annotation transfer we have considered the case of close and distant language pairs: Italian–Spanish and Italian–Greek. The corpora annotated via crowdsourcing are evaluated against source and target language expert annotations. We demonstrate that the two evaluation references (source and target) highly correlate with each other; thus, drastically reduce the need for the target language reference annotations."

Our annotation guidelines provide linguistic tests for identifying the antecedent, and for determining the semantic types of both the antecedent and the anaphor. The corpus consists of selected speaker turns from the Europarl corpus. To date, 100 texts have been annotated according to these guidelines. The annotations show that anaphoric personal and demonstrative pronouns differ with respect to the distance to their antecedents. A semantic analysis reveals that, contrary to suggestions put forward in the literature, referents of anaphors do not tend to be more abstract than the referents of their antecedents."

However, the meaningful use of EHR data largely depends on our ability to efficiently extract and consolidate information embedded in clinical text where natural language processing (NLP) techniques are essential. Semantic textual similarity (STS) that measures the semantic similarity between text snippets plays a significant role in many NLP applications. In the general NLP domain, STS shared tasks have made available a huge collection of text snippet pairs with manual annotations in various domains. In the clinical domain, STS can enable us to detect and eliminate redundant information that may lead to a reduction in cognitive burden and an improvement in the clinical decision-making process. This paper elaborates our efforts to assemble a resource for STS in the medical domain, MedSTS. It consists of a total of 174,629 sentence pairs gathered from a clinical corpus at Mayo Clinic. A subset of MedSTS (MedSTS_ann) containing 1068 sentence pairs was annotated by two medical experts with semantic similarity scores of 0–5 (low to high similarity). We further analyzed the medical concepts in the MedSTS corpus, and tested four STS systems on the MedSTS_ann corpus. In the future, we will organize a shared task by releasing the MedSTS_ann corpus to motivate the community to tackle the real world clinical problems."

Urdu language processing presents a challenge due to the dual behaviour of various Urdu POS tags in differing situations (morphosyntactic ambiguity). This paper addresses this challenge by developing a novel tagging approach using linear-chain conditional random fields (CRF). Our work is the first instance of a CRF approach for Urdu POS tagging. The proposed model employs a strong, stable and balanced language-independent as well as language dependent feature set. The language-dependent feature considered includes part-of-speech tag of the previous word and suffix of the current word while the language-independent features includes the ‘context words window’. Our approach was evaluated against support vector machine techniques for Urdu POS—considered as state of the art—on two benchmark datasets. The results show our CRF approach to improve upon the F-measure of prior attempts by 8.3–8.5%."

Most people of the Islamic World understand the Classic Arabic language because it is the language of the Qur’an. Despite the fact that in the last decade the number of Arabic Internet users (Middle East and North and East of Africa) has increased considerably, systems to analyze Arabic digital resources automatically are not as easily available as they are for English. Therefore, in this work, an attempt is made to build a real time Named Entity Recognition system that can be used in web applications to detect the appearance of specific named entities and events in news written in Arabic. Arabic is a highly inflectional language, thus we will try to minimize the impact of Arabic affixes on the quality of the pattern recognition model applied to identify named entities.

Fei XiaWilliam D. LewisMichael Wayne GoodmanGlenn SlaydenRyan GeorgiJoshua CrowgeyEmily M. Bender,Language Resources and Evaluation,enriching a massively multilingual database of interlinear glossed text,2016,"The majority of the world’s languages have little to no NLP resources or tools. This is due to a lack of training data (“resources”) over which tools, such as taggers or parsers, can be trained. In recent years, there have been increasing efforts to apply NLP methods to a much broader swath of the world’s languages. In many cases this involves bootstrapping the learning process with enriched or partially enriched resources. We propose that Interlinear Glossed Text (IGT), a very common form of annotated data used in the field of linguistics, has great potential for bootstrapping NLP tools for resource-poor languages. Although IGT is generally very richly annotated, and can be enriched even further (e.g., through structural projection), much of the content is not easily consumable by machines since it remains “trapped” in linguistic scholarly documents and in human readable form. In this paper, we describe the expansion of the ODIN resource—a database containing many thousands of instances of IGT for over a thousand languages. We enrich the original IGT data by adding word alignment and syntactic structure. To make the data in ODIN more readily consumable by tool developers and NLP researchers, we adopt and extend a new XML format for IGT, called Xigt. We also develop two packages for manipulating IGT data: one, INTENT, enriches raw IGT automatically, and the other, XigtEdit, is a graphical IGT editor."
Andrew Hardie,Language Resources and Evaluation,from legacy encodings to unicode the graphical and logical principles in the scripts of south asia,2007,"Much electronic text in the languages of South Asia has been published on the Internet. However, while Unicode has emerged as the favoured encoding system of corpus and computational linguists, most South Asian language data on the web uses one of a wide range of non-standard legacy encodings. This paper describes the difficulties inherent in converting text in these encodings to Unicode. Among the various legacy encodings for South Asian scripts, the most problematic are 8-bit fonts based on graphical principles (as opposed to the logical principles of Unicode). Graphical fonts typically encode several features in ways highly incompatible with Unicode. For instance, half-form glyphs used to construct conjunct consonants are typically separate code points in 8-bit fonts; in Unicode they are represented by the full consonant followed by virama. There are many more such cases. The solution described here is an approach to text conversion based on mapping rules. A small number of generalised rules (plus the capacity for more specialised rules) captures the behaviour of each character in a font, building up a conversion algorithm for that encoding. This system is embedded in a font-mapping program, outputting CES-compliant SGML Unicode. This program, a generalised text-conversion tool, has been employed extensively in corpus-building for South Asian languages."

Afsaneh FazlySuzanne StevensonRyan North,Language Resources and Evaluation,automatically learning semantic knowledge about multiword predicates,2007,"Highly frequent and highly polysemous verbs, such as give, take, and make, pose a challenge to automatic lexical acquisition methods. These verbs widely participate in multiword predicates (such as light verb constructions, or LVCs), in which they contribute a broad range of figurative meanings that must be recognized. Here we focus on two properties that are key to the computational treatment of LVCs. First, we consider the degree of figurativeness of the semantic contribution of such a verb to the various LVCs it participates in. Second, we explore the patterns of acceptability of LVCs, and their productivity over semantically related combinations. To assess these properties, we develop statistical measures of figurativeness and acceptability that draw on linguistic properties of LVCs. We demonstrate that these corpus-based measures correlate well with human judgments of the relevant property. We also use the acceptability measure to estimate the degree to which a semantic class of nouns can productively form LVCs with a given verb. The linguistically-motivated measures outperform a standard measure for capturing the strength of collocation of these multiword expressions."

Sentiment lexicons and word embeddings constitute well-established sources of information for sentiment analysis in online social media.

We present and make publicly available a rich set of such resources, ranging from a manually annotated lexicon, to semi-supervised word embedding vectors and annotated datasets for different tasks. Our experiments using different algorithms and parameters on our resources show promising results over standard baselines; on average, we achieve a 24.9% relative improvement in F-score on the cross-domain sentiment analysis task when training the same algorithms with our resources, compared to training them on more traditional feature sources, such as n-grams. Importantly, while our resources were built with the primary focus on the cross-domain sentiment analysis task, they also show promising results in related tasks, such as emotion analysis and sarcasm detection."

Su Nam KimTimothy Baldwin,Language Resources and Evaluation,how to pick out token instances of english verb particle constructions,2010,We propose a method for automatically identifying individual instances of English verb-particle constructions (VPCs) in raw text. Our method employs the RASP parser and analysis of the sentential context of each VPC candidate to differentiate VPCs from simple combinations of a verb and prepositional phrase. We show that our proposed method has an F-score of 0.974 at VPC identification over the Brown Corpus and Wall Street Journal.

In this paper we describe the TempEval task and the systems that participated in the evaluation. In addition, we describe how further task decomposition can bring even more structure to the evaluation of temporal relations."
Mai OudahKhaled Shaalan,Language Resources and Evaluation,studying the impact of language independent and language specific features on hybrid arabic person name recognition,2017,"In this paper, extensive experiments are conducted to study the impact of features of different categories, in isolation and gradually in an incremental manner, on Arabic Person name recognition. We present an integrated system that employs the rule-based approach with the machine learning (ML)-based approach in order to develop a consolidated hybrid system. Our feature space is comprised of language-independent and language-specific features. The explored features are naturally grouped under six categories: Person named entity tags predicted by the rule-based component, word-level features, POS features, morphological features, gazetteer features, and other contextual features. As decision tree algorithm has proved comparatively higher efficiency as a classifier in current state-of-the-art hybrid Named Entity Recognition for Arabic, it is adopted in this study as the ML technique utilized by the hybrid system. Therefore, the experiments are focused on two dimensions: the standard dataset used and the set of selected features. A number of standard datasets are used for the training and testing of the hybrid system, including ACE (2003–2004) and ANERcorp. The experimental analysis indicates that both language-independent and language-specific features play an important role in overcoming the challenges posed by Arabic language and have demonstrated critical impact on optimizing the performance of the hybrid system."

We present our annotation workflow that harnesses crowd intelligence, and discuss the procedures for ensuring annotation consistency and quality control. Our discussion focuses on syntactic variations in realization of predicate-argument structures, and the large lexicon problem caused by complex derivational morphology. We describe our approach that exploits framesets of root verbs to abstract away from syntax and increase self-consistency of the Turkish PropBank. The issues that arise in the annotation of verbs derived via valency changing morphemes, verbal nominals, and nominal verbs are explored, and evaluation results for inter-annotator agreement are provided. Furthermore, semantic layer described here is aligned with universal dependency (UD) compliant treebank and released to enable more researchers to work on the problem. Finally, we use PropBank to establish a baseline score of 79.10 F1 for Turkish SRL using the mate-tool (an open-source SRL tool based on supervised machine learning) enhanced with basic morphological features. Turkish PropBank and the extended SRL system are made publicly available.

Simon CarterWouter WeerkampManos Tsagkias,Language Resources and Evaluation,microblog language identification overcoming the limitations of short unedited and idiomatic text,2013,"Multilingual posts can potentially affect the outcomes of content analysis on microblog platforms. To this end, language identification can provide a monolingual set of content for analysis. We find the unedited and idiomatic language of microblogs to be challenging for state-of-the-art language identification methods. To account for this, we identify five microblog characteristics that can help in language identification: the language profile of the blogger (blogger), the content of an attached hyperlink (link), the language profile of other users mentioned (mention) in the post, the language profile of a tag (tag), and the language of the original post (conversation), if the post we examine is a reply. Further, we present methods that combine these priors in a post-dependent and post-independent way. We present test results on 1,000 posts from five languages (Dutch, English, French, German, and Spanish), which show that our priors improve accuracy by 5 % over a domain specific baseline, and show that post-dependent combination of the priors achieves the best performance. When suitable training data does not exist, our methods still outperform a domain unspecific baseline. We conclude with an examination of the language distribution of a million tweets, along with temporal analysis, the usage of twitter features across languages, and a correlation study between classifications made and geo-location and language metadata fields."

In this paper, we present a study of the dependency relations in Bangla language. We have categorized these relations in three different levels, namely intrachunk relations, interchunk relations and interclause relations. Each of these levels is further categorized and an annotation scheme has been developed. Both syntactic and semantic features have been taken into consideration for describing the relations. In our scheme, there are 63 such syntactico–semantic relations. We have verified the scheme by tagging a corpus of 4167 Bangla sentences to create a treebank (KGPBenTreebank)."
Violeta SeretanEric Wehrli,Language Resources and Evaluation,multilingual collocation extraction with a syntactic parser,2009,"An impressive amount of work was devoted over the past few decades to collocation extraction. The state of the art shows that there is a sustained interest in the morphosyntactic preprocessing of texts in order to better identify candidate expressions; however, the treatment performed is, in most cases, limited (lemmatization, POS-tagging, or shallow parsing). This article presents a collocation extraction system based on the full parsing of source corpora, which supports four languages: English, French, Spanish, and Italian. The performance of the system is compared against that of the standard mobile-window method. The evaluation experiment investigates several levels of the significance lists, uses a fine-grained annotation schema, and covers all the languages supported. Consistent results were obtained for these languages: parsing, even if imperfect, leads to a significant improvement in the quality of results, in terms of collocational precision (between 16.4 and 29.7%, depending on the language; 20.1% overall), MWE precision (between 19.9 and 35.8%; 26.1% overall), and grammatical precision (between 47.3 and 67.4%; 55.6% overall). This positive result bears a high importance, especially in the perspective of the subsequent integration of extraction results in other NLP applications."

As our media increasingly become more social, the problem of irony detection will become even more pressing. We describe here a set of textual features for recognizing irony at a linguistic level, especially in short texts created via social media such as Twitter postings or “tweets”. Our experiments concern four freely available data sets that were retrieved from Twitter using content words (e.g. “Toyota”) and user-generated tags (e.g. “#irony”). We construct a new model of irony detection that is assessed along two dimensions: representativeness and relevance. Initial results are largely positive, and provide valuable insights into the figurative issues facing tasks such as sentiment analysis, assessment of online reputations, or decision making."

They provide training and testing materials so that different algorithms can be compared. However, it is not a trivial task to construct high-quality treebanks. We have not yet had a proper treebank for such a low-resource language as Vietnamese, which has probably lowered the performance of Vietnamese language processing. We have been building a consistent and accurate Vietnamese treebank to alleviate such situations. Our treebank is annotated with three layers: word segmentation, part-of-speech tagging, and bracketing. We developed detailed annotation guidelines for each layer by presenting Vietnamese linguistic issues as well as methods of addressing them. Here, we also describe approaches to controlling annotation quality while ensuring a reasonable annotation speed. We specifically designed an appropriate annotation process and an effective process to train annotators. In addition, we implemented several support tools to improve annotation speed and to control the consistency of the treebank. The results from experiments revealed that both inter-annotator agreement and accuracy were higher than 90%, which indicated that the treebank is reliable.

The term MWE has been used to refer to various types of linguistic units and expressions, including idioms, noun compounds, phrasal verbs, light verbs and other habitual collocations. However, while there is no universally agreed definition for MWE as yet, most researchers use the term to refer to those frequently occurring phrasal units which are subject to certain level of semantic opaqueness, or non-compositionality. Non-compositional MWEs pose tough challenges for automatic analysis because their interpretation cannot be achieved by directly combining the semantics of their constituents, thereby causing the “pain in the neck of NLP” (Sag et al. 2001)."
Liang WuFred MorstatterHuan Liu,Language Resources and Evaluation,slangsd building expanding and using a sentiment dictionary of slang words for short text sentiment classification,2018,"Sentiment information about social media posts is increasingly considered an important resource for customer segmentation, market understanding, and tackling other socio-economic issues.
 However, sentiment in social media is difficult to measure since user-generated content is usually short and informal. Although many traditional sentiment analysis methods have been proposed, identifying slang sentiment words remains a challenging task for practitioners. Though some slang words are available in existing sentiment lexicons, with new slang being generated with emerging memes, a dedicated lexicon will be useful for researchers and practitioners. To this end, we propose to build a slang sentiment dictionary to aid sentiment analysis.
 It is laborious and time-consuming to collect a comprehensive list of slang words and label the sentiment polarity. We present an approach to leverage web resources to construct a Slang Sentiment Dictionary (SlangSD) that is easy to expand. SlangSD is publicly available for research purposes. We empirically show the advantages of using SlangSD, the newly-built slang sentiment word dictionary for sentiment classification, and provide examples demonstrating its ease of use with a sentiment analysis system."

The main goal is to complete the comparative analysis from the SemEval-2010 task on Coreference Resolution in Multiple Languages. To do so, the study restricts the number of languages and systems involved, but extends and deepens the analysis of the system outputs, including a more qualitative discussion. The paper compares three automatic coreference resolution systems for three languages (English, Catalan and Spanish) in four evaluation settings, and using four evaluation measures. Given that our main goal is not to provide a comparison between resolution algorithms, these are merely used as tools to shed light on the different conditions under which coreference resolution is evaluated. Although the dimensions are strongly interdependent, making it very difficult to extract general principles, the study reveals a series of interesting issues in relation to coreference resolution: the portability of systems across languages, the influence of the type and quality of input annotations, and the behavior of the scoring measures."

It has always been thought, however, that WSD could also benefit from deeper knowledge sources. We describe a novel approach to WSD using inductive logic programming to learn theories from first-order logic representations that allows corpus-based evidence to be combined with any kind of background knowledge. This approach has been shown to be effective over several disambiguation tasks using a combination of deep and shallow knowledge sources. Is it important to understand the contribution of the various knowledge sources used in such a system. This paper investigates the contribution of nine knowledge sources to the performance of the disambiguation models produced for the SemEval-2007 English lexical sample task. The outcome of this analysis will assist future work on WSD in concentrating on the most useful knowledge sources."

We then present the results of training our system on OntoNotes data, both the SemEval-2007 task and additional data. OntoNotes data is designed to provide clear sense distinctions, based on using explicit syntactic and semantic criteria to group WordNet senses, with sufficient examples to constitute high quality, broad coverage training data. Using similar syntactic and semantic features for WSD, we achieve performance comparable to that of human taggers, and competitive with the top results for the SemEval-2007 task. Empirical analysis of our results suggests that clarifying sense boundaries and/or increasing the number of training instances for certain verbs could further improve system performance."

The database is labelled for six speaker attributes: boring; charismatic; enthusiastic; inspiring; likeable; and persuasive. Each of these traits is linked to the perceived ability or appeal of the speaker, and as such are relevant to a range of content retrieval and speech analysis tasks. The six base attributes are combined to form a metric of Overall Speaker Appeal.

Nicolas PécheuxGuillaume WisniewskiFrançois Yvon,Language Resources and Evaluation,reassessing the value of resources for cross lingual transfer of pos tagging models,2017,"When linguistically annotated data is scarce, as is the case for many under-resourced languages, one has to resort to less complete forms of annotations obtained from crawled dictionaries and/or through cross-lingual transfer. Several recent works have shown that learning from such partially supervised data can be effective in many practical situations. In this work, we review two existing proposals for learning with ambiguous labels which extend conventional learners to the weakly supervised setting: a history-based model using a variant of the perceptron, on the one hand; an extension of the Conditional Random Fields model on the other hand. Focusing on the part-of-speech tagging task, but considering a large set of ten languages, we show (a) that good performance can be achieved even in the presence of ambiguity, provided however that both monolingual and bilingual resources are available; (b) that our two learners exploit different characteristics of the training set, and are successful in different situations; (c) that in addition to the choice of an adequate learning algorithm, many other factors are critical for achieving good performance in a cross-lingual transfer setting."
Krister Lindén,Computers and the Humanities,evaluation of linguistic features for word sense disambiguation with self organized document maps,2004,"Word sense disambiguation automatically determines the appropriate senses of a word in context. We have previously shown that self-organized document maps have properties similar to a large-scale semantic structure that is useful for word sense disambiguation. This work evaluates the impact of different linguistic features on self-organized document maps for word sense disambiguation. The features evaluated are various qualitative features, e.g. part-of-speech and syntactic labels, and quantitative features, e.g. cut-off levels for word frequency. It is shown that linguistic features help make contextual information explicit. If the training corpus is large even contextually weak features, such as base forms, will act in concert to produce sense distinctions in a statistically significant way. However, the most important features are syntactic dependency relations and base forms annotated with part of speech or syntactic labels. We achieve 62.9% ± 0.73% correct results on the fine grained lexical task of the English SENSEVAL-2 data. On the 96.7% of the test cases which need no back-off to the most frequent sense we achieve 65.7% correct results."
Marta R. Costa-jussàRafael E. Banchs,Language Resources and Evaluation,automatic normalization of short texts by combining statistical and rule based techniques,2013,"Short texts are typically composed of small number of words, most of which are abbreviations, typos and other kinds of noise. This makes the noise to signal ratio relatively high for this specific category of text. A high proportion of noise in the data is undesirable for analysis procedures as well as machine learning applications. Text normalization techniques are used to reduce the noise and improve the quality of text for processing and analysis purposes. In this work, we propose a combination of statistical and rule-based techniques to normalize short texts. More specifically, we focus our attention on SMS messages. We base our normalization approach on a statistical machine translation system which translates from noisy data to clean data. This system is trained on a small manually annotated set. Then, we study several automatic methods to extract more general rules from the normalizations generated with the statistical machine translation system. We illustrate the proposed methodology by conducting some experiments with a SMS Haitian-Créole data collection.

Elisabet ComellesJordi Atserias,Language Resources and Evaluation,verta a linguistic approach to automatic machine translation evaluation,2019,"Machine translation (MT) is directly linked to its evaluation in order to both compare different MT system outputs and analyse system errors so that they can be addressed and corrected. As a consequence, MT evaluation has become increasingly important and popular in the last decade, leading to the development of MT evaluation metrics aiming at automatically assessing MT output. Most of these metrics use reference translations in order to compare system output, and the most well-known and widely spread work at lexical level. In this study we describe and present a linguistically-motivated metric, VERTa, which aims at using and combining a wide variety of linguistic features at lexical, morphological, syntactic and semantic level. Before designing and developing VERTa a qualitative linguistic analysis of data was performed so as to identify the linguistic phenomena that an MT metric must consider (Comelles et al. 2017). In the present study we introduce VERTa’s design and architecture and we report the experiments performed in order to develop the metric and to check the suitability and interaction of the linguistic information used. The experiments carried out go beyond traditional correlation scores and step towards a more qualitative approach based on linguistic analysis. Finally, in order to check the validity of the metric, an evaluation has been conducted comparing the metric’s performance to that of other well-known state-of-the-art MT metrics."

Diana McCarthyRoberto Navigli,Language Resources and Evaluation,the english lexical substitution task,2009,"Since the inception of the Senseval series there has been a great deal of debate in the word sense disambiguation (WSD) community on what the right sense distinctions are for evaluation, with the consensus of opinion being that the distinctions should be relevant to the intended application. A solution to the above issue is lexical substitution, i.e. the replacement of a target word in context with a suitable alternative substitute. In this paper, we describe the English lexical substitution task and report an exhaustive evaluation of the systems participating in the task organized at SemEval-2007. The aim of this task is to provide an evaluation where the sense inventory is not predefined and where performance on the task would bode well for applications. The task not only reflects WSD capabilities, but also can be used to compare lexical resources, whether man-made or automatically created, and has the potential to benefit several natural-language applications."

David JurgensMohammad Taher PilehvarRoberto Navigli,Language Resources and Evaluation,cross level semantic similarity an evaluation framework for universal measures of similarity,2016,"Semantic similarity has typically been measured across items of approximately similar sizes. As a result, similarity measures have largely ignored the fact that different types of linguistic item can potentially have similar or even identical meanings, and therefore are designed to compare only one type of linguistic item. Furthermore, nearly all current similarity benchmarks within NLP contain pairs of approximately the same size, such as word or sentence pairs, preventing the evaluation of methods that are capable of comparing different sized items. To address this, we introduce a new semantic evaluation called cross-level semantic similarity (CLSS), which measures the degree to which the meaning of a larger linguistic item, such as a paragraph, is captured by a smaller item, such as a sentence. Our pilot CLSS task was presented as part of SemEval-2014, which attracted 19 teams who submitted 38 systems. CLSS data contains a rich mixture of pairs, spanning from paragraphs to word senses to fully evaluate similarity measures that are capable of comparing items of any type. Furthermore, data sources were drawn from diverse corpora beyond just newswire, including domain-specific texts and social media. We describe the annotation process and its challenges, including a comparison with crowdsourcing, and identify the factors that make the dataset a rigorous assessment of a method’s quality. Furthermore, we examine in detail the systems participating in the SemEval task to identify the common factors associated with high performance and which aspects proved difficult to all systems. Our findings demonstrate that CLSS poses a significant challenge for similarity methods and provides clear directions for future work on universal similarity methods that can compare any pair of items."

The paper motivates the linguistic principles of data sampling and annotation and shows the task’s feasibility via human agreement. The five participating systems mainly used supervised approaches exploiting a variety of features, of which grammatical relations proved to be the most useful. We compare the systems’ performance to automatic baselines as well as to a manually simulated approach based on selectional restriction violations, showing some limitations of this more traditional approach to metonymy recognition. The main problem supervised systems encountered is data sparseness, since metonymies in general tend to occur more rarely than literal uses. Also, within metonymies, the reading distribution is skewed towards a few frequent metonymy types. Future task developments should focus on addressing this issue."

Xiaopeng BaiNianwen Xue,Language Resources and Evaluation,generalizing the semantic roles in the chinese proposition bank,2016,"The Chinese Proposition Bank (CPB) is a 
corpus annotated with semantic roles for the arguments of verbal and nominalized predicates. The semantic roles for the core arguments are defined in a predicate-specific manner. That is, a set of semantic roles, numerically identified, are defined for each sense of a predicate lemma and recorded in a valency lexicon called frame files. The predicate-specific manner in which the semantic roles are defined reduces the cognitive burden on the annotators since they only need to internalize a few roles at a time and this has contributed to the consistency in annotation. It was also a sensible approach given the contentious issue of how many semantic roles are needed if one were to adopt of set of global semantic roles that apply to all predicates. A downside of this approach, however, is that the predicate-specific roles may not be consistent across predicates, and this inconsistency has a negative impact on training automatic systems. Given the progress that has been made in defining semantic roles in the last decade or so, time is ripe for adopting a set of general semantic roles. In this article, we describe our effort to “re-annotate” the CPB with a set of “global” semantic roles that are predicate-independent and investigate their impact on automatic semantic role labeling systems. When defining these global semantic roles, we strive to make them compatible with a recently published ISO standards on the annotation of semantic roles (ISO 24617-4:2014 SemAF-SR) while taking the linguistic characteristics of the Chinese language into account. We show that in spite of the much larger number of global semantic roles, the accuracy of an off-the-shelf semantic role labeling system retrained on the data re-annotated with global semantic roles is comparable to that trained on the data set with the original predicate-specific semantic roles. We also argue that the re-annotated data set, together with the original data, provides the user with more flexibility when using the corpus."
Łukasz Dębowski,Language Resources and Evaluation,valence extraction using em selection and co occurrence matrices,2009,"This paper discusses two new procedures for extracting verb valences from raw texts, with an application to the Polish language. The first novel technique, the EM selection algorithm, performs unsupervised disambiguation of valence frame forests, obtained by applying a non-probabilistic deep grammar parser and some post-processing to the text. The second new idea concerns filtering of incorrect frames detected in the parsed text and is motivated by an observation that verbs which take similar arguments tend to have similar frames. This phenomenon is described in terms of newly introduced co-occurrence matrices. Using co-occurrence matrices, we split filtering into two steps. The list of valid arguments is first determined for each verb, whereas the pattern according to which the arguments are combined into frames is computed in the following stage. Our best extracted dictionary reaches an F-score of 45%, compared to an F-score of 39% for the standard frame-based BHT filtering."
Tomohiro OhnoShigeki MatsubaraHideki KashiokaTakehiko MaruyamaHideki TanakaYasuyoshi Inagaki,Language Resources and Evaluation,dependency parsing of japanese monologue using clause boundaries,2006,"Spoken monologues feature greater sentence length and structural complexity than spoken dialogues. To achieve high-parsing performance for spoken monologues, simplifying the structure by dividing a sentence into suitable language units could prove effective. This paper proposes a method for dependency parsing of Japanese spoken monologues based on sentence segmentation. In this method, dependency parsing is executed in two stages: at the clause level and the sentence level. First, dependencies within a clause are identified by dividing a sentence into clauses and executing stochastic dependency parsing for each clause. Next, dependencies across clause boundaries are identified stochastically, and the dependency structure of the entire sentence is thus completed. An experiment using a spoken monologue corpus shows the effectiveness of this method for efficient dependency parsing of Japanese monologue sentences."

The distinctiveness of the MoveOn database results from the requirements of the application domain—an information support and operational command and control system for the two-wheel police force—and also from the specifics of the adverse open-air acoustic environment.

Rachele SprugnoliGiovanni MorettiLuisa BentivogliDiego Giuliani,Language Resources and Evaluation,creating a ground truth multilingual dataset of news and talk show transcriptions through crowdsourcing,2017,"This paper describes the development of a multilingual and multigenre manually annotated speech dataset, freely available to the research community as ground truth for the evaluation of automatic transcription systems and spoken language translation systems. The dataset includes two video genres—television broadcast news and talk-shows—and covers Flemish, English, German, and Italian, for a total of about 35 h of television speech. Besides segmentation and orthographic transcription, we added a very rich annotation on the audio signal, both at the linguistic level (e.g. filled pauses, pronunciation errors, disfluencies, speech in a foreign language) and at the acoustic level (e.g. background noise and different types of non-speech events). Furthermore, a subset of the transcriptions is translated in four directions, namely Flemish to English, German to English, German to Italian and English to Italian. The development of this dataset was organized in several phases, relying on expert transcribers as well as involving non-expert contributors through crowdsourcing. We first conducted a feasibility study to test and compare two methods for crowdsourcing speech transcription on broadcast news data. These methods are based on different transcription processes (i.e. parallel vs. iterative) and incorporate two different quality control mechanisms. With both methods, we achieved near-expert transcription quality—in terms of word error rate—for English, German and Italian data. Instead, for Flemish data we were not able to get a sufficient response from the crowd to complete the offered transcription tasks. The results obtained demonstrate that the viability of methods for crowdsourcing speech transcription significantly depends on the target language. This paper provides a detailed comparison of the results obtained with the two crowdsourcing methods tested, describes the main characteristics of the final ground truth resource created as well as the methodology adopted, and the guidelines prepared for its development."

In general, machine translation systems trained and tuned on a general domain perform poorly on specific domains and we show that such systems can be adapted successfully by retuning model parameters using small amounts of parallel in-domain data, and may be further improved by using additional monolingual and parallel training data for adaptation of language and translation models.

Laurette PretoriusBiffie ViljoenAnsu BergRigardt Pretorius,Language Resources and Evaluation,tswana finite state tokenisation,2015,"Tswana, a Bantu language in the Sotho group, is characterised by an agglutinative morphology and a disjunctive orthography, which mainly affects the verb category. In particular, verbal prefixes are usually written disjunctively, while suffixes follow a conjunctive writing style. Therefore, Tswana tokenisation cannot be based solely on whitespace, as is the case in many alphabetic, segmented languages, including the conjunctively written Nguni group of South African Bantu languages. This paper shows how a combination of two finite state tokeniser transducers and a finite state morphological analyser are combined to solve the Tswana (verb) tokenisation problem. The approach has the important advantage of bringing the processing of Tswana, beyond the morphological analysis level, in line with what is appropriate for the Nguni languages. This means that the challenge of the disjunctive orthography is met at the tokenisation/morphological analysis level and does not in principle propagate to subsequent levels of analysis such as POS tagging and shallow parsing, etc. The tokenisation approach is novel and, when implemented and evaluated, yields an F1-score of 95 % with respect to a hand tokenised gold standard."

We call this problem class intrinsic plagiarism analysis; it is closely related to the problem of authorship verification. Our contributions are threefold. (1) We organize the algorithmic building blocks for intrinsic plagiarism analysis and authorship verification and survey the state of the art.

Michael WiegandManfred KlennerDietrich Klakow,Language Resources and Evaluation,bootstrapping polarity classifiers with rule based classification,2013,"In this article, we examine the effectiveness of bootstrapping supervised machine-learning polarity classifiers with the help of a domain-independent rule-based classifier that relies on a lexical resource, i.e., a polarity lexicon and a set of linguistic rules. The benefit of this method is that though no labeled training data are required, it allows a classifier to capture in-domain knowledge by training a supervised classifier with in-domain features, such as bag of words, on instances labeled by a rule-based classifier. Thus, this approach can be considered as a simple and effective method for domain adaptation. Among the list of components of this approach, we investigate how important the quality of the rule-based classifier is and what features are useful for the supervised classifier. In particular, the former addresses the issue in how far linguistic modeling is relevant for this task. We not only examine how this method performs under more difficult settings in which classes are not balanced and mixed reviews are included in the data set but also compare how this linguistically-driven method relates to state-of-the-art statistical domain adaptation."

Katherine O'Brien O'KeeffeWilliam Rundell,Computers and the Humanities,an information theoretic approach to the written transmission of old english,1989,"Information theory offers a means for analyzing some constraints on the reading and copying process in Old English. Entropy for strings of various lengths offers a baseline measure of the uncertainty involved in transmission of Old English texts, while avoiding the pitfalls of applying models of modern reading to early medieval practice. Analysis of lengthy prose and verse texts in Old English revealed uniformly high values for entropy at all string lengths. High entropies may be the result of the language's irregular orthography, poetic koiné, and several dialects and imply that the language may have been easy to write but difficult to read. The low redundancy of the language which its high entropy values indicate suggests that the reader of Old English played an enhanced role in “decoding” a text and may provide an explanation for the high variability in the transmission of Old English verse."

Amine AbdaouiJérôme AzéSandra BringayPascal Poncelet,Language Resources and Evaluation,feel a french expanded emotion lexicon,2017,"Sentiment analysis allows the semantic evaluation of pieces of text according to the expressed sentiments and opinions. While considerable attention has been given to the polarity (positive, negative) of English words, only few studies were interested in the conveyed emotions (joy, anger, surprise, sadness, etc.) especially in other languages. In this paper, we present the elaboration and the evaluation of a new French lexicon considering both polarity and emotion. The elaboration method is based on the semi-automatic translation and expansion to synonyms of the English NRC Word Emotion Association Lexicon (NRC-EmoLex). First, online translators have been automatically queried in order to create a first version of our new French Expanded Emotion Lexicon (FEEL). Then, a human professional translator manually validated the automatically obtained entries and the associated emotions. She agreed with more than 94 % of the pre-validated entries (those found by a majority of translators) and less than 18 % of the remaining entries (those found by very few translators). This result highlights that online tools can be used to get high quality resources with low cost. Annotating a subset of terms by three different annotators shows that the associated sentiments and emotions are consistent. Finally, extensive experiments have been conducted to compare the final version of FEEL with other existing French lexicons. Various French benchmarks for polarity and emotion classifications have been used in these evaluations. Experiments have shown that FEEL obtains competitive results for polarity, and significantly better results for basic emotions."

Ines RehbeinJosef RuppenhoferCaroline Sporleder,Language Resources and Evaluation,is it worth the effort assessing the benefits of partial automatic pre labeling for frame semantic annotation,2012,"Corpora with high-quality linguistic annotations are an essential component in many NLP applications and a valuable resource for linguistic research. For obtaining these annotations, a large amount of manual effort is needed, making the creation of these resources time-consuming and costly. One attempt to speed up the annotation process is to use supervised machine-learning systems to automatically assign (possibly erroneous) labels to the data and ask human annotators to correct them where necessary. However, it is not clear to what extent these automatic pre-annotations are successful in reducing human annotation effort, and what impact they have on the quality of the resulting resource. In this article, we present the results of an experiment in which we assess the usefulness of partial semi-automatic annotation for frame labeling. We investigate the impact of automatic pre-annotation of differing quality on annotation time, consistency and accuracy. While we found no conclusive evidence that it can speed up human annotation, we found that automatic pre-annotation does increase its overall quality."

 Proper evaluation of keyphrase extraction requires large test collections with multiple opinions, currently not available for research. In this paper, we (i) present a set of test collections derived from various sources with multiple annotations (which we also refer to as opinions in the remained of the paper) for each document, (ii) systematically evaluate keyphrase extraction using several supervised and unsupervised AKE techniques, (iii) and experimentally analyze the effects of disagreement on AKE evaluation. Our newly created set of test collections spans different types of topical content from general news and magazines, and is annotated with multiple annotations per article by a large annotator panel. Our annotator study shows that for a given document there seems to be a large disagreement on the preferred keyphrases, suggesting the need for multiple opinions per document. A first systematic evaluation of ranking and classification of keyphrases using both unsupervised and supervised AKE techniques on the test collections shows a superior effectiveness of supervised models, even for a low annotation effort and with basic positional and frequency features, and highlights the importance of a suitable keyphrase candidate generation approach. We also study the influence of multiple opinions, training data and document length on evaluation of keyphrase extraction.
 Our new test collection for keyphrase extraction is one of the largest of its kind and will be made available to stimulate future work to improve reliable evaluation of new keyphrase extractors."
Sam Coates-Stephens,Computers and the Humanities,the analysis and acquisition of proper names for the understanding of free text,1992,"Proper Names (PNs) present a problem for the automatic processing and understanding of naturally occurring text. Due to their poor coverage in existing lexical resources and the continual appearance of new names, they represent a large body of unknown lexical data. Moreover, the complexity of the constructions in which they can appear and their own internal structure make them difficult to process, even if they are initially known. Yet the successful analysis of names is often crucial to the full understanding of a text. This paper proposes a solution to the problem and describes a natural language processing (NLP) system, FUMES, which makes use of the internal structure of names and the descriptive information that regularly accompanies them to produce lexical and knowledge base entries for unknown PNs. We present some preliminary results showing the viability of this approach for the identification of proper names."

We are using CLASSIC, a frame-based representation system developed at AT&T Bell Laboratories. Like many KR systems, CLASSIC enables the definition of structured concepts/frames, their organization into taxonomies, the creation and manipulation of individual instances of such concepts, and inference such as inheritance, relation transitivity, inverses, etc. In addition, CLASSIC provides for the key inferences of subsumption and classification. By representing a document as an individual instance of a hierarchy of concepts derived from the DTD, and by allowing the creation of additional user-defined concepts and relations, sophisticated query and retrieval operations can be performed. This paper describes CLASSIC and the formalism of description logic that underlies it, and demonstrates how it can be used for enhanced retrieval from richly encoded documents."

Manfred Thaller,Computers and the Humanities,the historical workstation project,1991,"Since 1978 research in the development of software dedicated to the specific problems of historical research has been undertaken at the Max-Planck-Institute für Geschichte in Göttingen. From a background of practical experiences during these years, a concept of what an appropriate ‘workstation” for an historian would be has been derived. It stresses the necessity of three components: (a) software, derived from a detailed analysis of what differentiates information contained in historical sources from such present in current material, (b) databases which are as easily available as printed books and (c) knowledge bases which allow software and data bases to draw upon the information contained in historical reference works. A loose network of European research projects, dedicated to the realization of such a setup, is described."
Michael KippMichael NeffIrene Albrecht,Language Resources and Evaluation,an annotation scheme for conversational gestures how to economically capture timing and form,2007,"The empirical investigation of human gesture stands at the center of multiple research disciplines, and various gesture annotation schemes exist, with varying degrees of precision and required annotation effort. We present a gesture annotation scheme for the specific purpose of automatically generating and animating character-specific hand/arm gestures, but with potential general value. We focus on how to capture temporal structure and locational information with relatively little annotation effort. The scheme is evaluated in terms of how accurately it captures the original gestures by re-creating those gestures on an animated character using the annotated data. This paper presents our scheme in detail and compares it to other approaches."

In particular, our aim is to retrieve relevant information about a place or an object pictured in an image in order to provide a short summary which will be of great help for a tourist. For tackling this task, we proposed a broad set of experiments using crowdsourcing services that could be useful as a reference for others who want to rely also on crowdsourcing. From the analysis carried out through our experimental setup and the results obtained, we can conclude that although crowdsourcing services were not good to simply gather gold-standard summaries (i.e., from the results obtained for experiments 1, 2 and 4), the encouraging results obtained in the third and sixth experiments motivate us to strongly believe that they can be successfully employed for finding some patterns of behaviour humans have when generating summaries, and for validating and checking other tasks. Furthermore, this analysis serves as a guideline for the types of experiments that might or might not work when using crowdsourcing in the context of text summarization."

The ubiquitousness of PWN-type wordnets tends to overshadow the fact that they represent one out of many possible choices for structuring a lexical–semantic resource, and it could be enlightening to look at a differently structured resource both from the point of view of theoretical–methodological considerations and from the point of view of practical text processing requirements. The resource described here—SALDO—is such a lexical–semantic resource, intended primarily for use in language technology applications, and offering an alternative organization to PWN-style wordnets. We present our work on SALDO, compare it with PWN, and discuss some implications of the differences. We also describe an integrated infrastructure for computational lexical resources where SALDO forms the central component."
Themistoklis DiamantopoulosMichael RothAndreas SymeonidisEwan Klein,Language Resources and Evaluation,software requirements as an application domain for natural language processing,2017,"Mapping functional requirements first to specifications and then to code is one of the most challenging tasks in software development. Since requirements are commonly written in natural language, they can be prone to ambiguity, incompleteness and inconsistency. Structured semantic representations allow requirements to be translated to formal models, which can be used to detect problems at an early stage of the development process through validation. Storing and querying such models can also facilitate software reuse. Several approaches constrain the input format of requirements to produce specifications, however they usually require considerable human effort in order to adopt domain-specific heuristics and/or controlled languages. We propose a mechanism that automates the mapping of requirements to formal representations using semantic role labeling. We describe the first publicly available dataset for this task, employ a hierarchical framework that allows requirements concepts to be annotated, and discuss how semantic role labeling can be adapted for parsing software requirements.

Jean-Jacques Thomas,Computers and the Humanities,texts on line,1993,"The study of signs is divided between those scholars who use the Saussurian binary sign (semiology) and those who prefer Charles Peirce's tripartite sign (semiotics). The common view of the opposition between the two types of signs does not take into consideration the methodological conditions of applicability of these two types of signs. This is particularly important in the field of literary studies and hence for the preparation of electronic programs for text analysis. The Peircian sign explicitly entails the discovery of a truth of meaning that claims to be universal and not reducible to a collection of opinions based on fragmented information; it also imposes the task of elucidating a transhistorical and universal significantion encoded in a text. Contrary to Peirce's view of the sign, our use of computer programs for text analysis, however, demonstrates that we implicitly treat every literary text as a set of linguistic data (letters, phonemes, syntagmatic segments, etc.) which are reducible to units that can be treated separately. A brief comparison of the results obtained from computer analyses of the French poet Stéphane Mallarmé's text, “Le Cygne,” with those obtained from two Peircian analyses (by Riffaterre and Champigny) of the same text demonstrates that our current methods of computer textual analysis are based on a Saussurian semiology, which is unidimensional and limited, and that these methods are still quite unable to produce a semiotic interpretation based on a totalizing hierarchy of the text's various discursive components."

Moreover, the known texts and the anonymous texts might be of limited length. We show that even in these difficult cases, we can use similarity-based methods along with multiple randomized feature sets to achieve high precision.

Cluster number identification is built on a Gaussian mixture model with a MDL-based criterion, and the optimal model order is inferred by minimizing the criterion. To evaluate closeness between the learned sense clusters with the ground-truth classes, we introduce a kind of weighted F-measure to model the effort needed to reconstruct the classes from the clusters. Experiments show that the algorithm can retrieve important features, roughly estimate the class numbers automatically and outperforms other algorithms in terms of the weighted F-measure. In addition, we also try to apply the algorithm to a specific task of adding new words into a Chinese thesaurus."

Alejandro RagoClaudia MarcosJ. Andres Diaz-Pace,Language Resources and Evaluation,using semantic roles to improve text classification in the requirements domain,2018,"Engineering activities often produce considerable documentation as a by-product of the development process. Due to their complexity, technical analysts can benefit from text processing techniques able to identify concepts of interest and analyze deficiencies of the documents in an automated fashion. In practice, text sentences from the documentation are usually transformed to a vector space model, which is suitable for traditional machine learning classifiers. However, such transformations suffer from problems of synonyms and ambiguity that cause classification mistakes. For alleviating these problems, there has been a growing interest in the semantic enrichment of text. Unfortunately, using general-purpose thesaurus and encyclopedias to enrich technical documents belonging to a given domain (e.g. requirements engineering) often introduces noise and does not improve classification. In this work, we aim at boosting text classification by exploiting information about semantic roles. We have explored this approach when building a multi-label classifier for identifying special concepts, called domain actions, in textual software requirements. After evaluating various combinations of semantic roles and text classification algorithms, we found that this kind of semantically-enriched data leads to improvements of up to 18% in both precision and recall, when compared to non-enriched data. Our enrichment strategy based on semantic roles also allowed classifiers to reach acceptable accuracy levels with small training sets. Moreover, semantic roles outperformed Wikipedia- and WordNET-based enrichments, which failed to boost requirements classification with several techniques. These results drove the development of two requirements tools, which we successfully applied in the processing of textual use cases."
Mpho RaborifeSigrid EwertSabine Zerbian,Language Resources and Evaluation,improving a tone labeling algorithm for sesotho,2015,"
We report on a study that aimed to improve an existing tone label prediction algorithm for Sesotho, an official language of South Africa. Tone is an important prosodic feature of Sesotho, since speakers use tone to distinguish meaning. In order to implement tone in a Text-to-Speech system for Sesotho, a tone modeling algorithm must receive as input the tone labels of the syllables of each word. Then it can predict the appropriate intonation of the word. Since Sesotho does not mark tone labels in orthography, the labels have to be predicted according to the tonal rules of the language. The existing tone label prediction algorithm has two drawbacks, namely it implements three tonal rules only and is restricted to the clitic phrase domain. In our study, we developed an algorithm that implements four additional tonal rules and addresses all parts of speech. The results show that the latter algorithm significantly improves the existing one by increasing the number of matched tone labels.

Arianne ReimerinkPilar León-AraúzPamela Faber,Language Resources and Evaluation,image selection and annotation for an environmental knowledge base,2016,"Images play an important role in the representation and acquisition of specialized knowledge. Not surprisingly, terminological knowledge bases (TKBs) often include images as a way to enhance the information in concept entries. However, the selection of these images should not be random, but rather based on specific guidelines that take into account the type and nature of the concept being described. This paper presents a proposal on how to combine the features of images with the conceptual propositions in EcoLexicon, a multilingual TKB on the environment. This proposal is based on the following: (1) the combinatory possibilities of concept types; (2) image types, such as photographs, drawings and flow charts; (3) morphological features or visual knowledge patterns (VKPs), such as labels, colours, arrows, and their effect on the functional nature of each image type. Currently, images are stored in association with concept entries according to the semantic content of their definitions, but they are not described or annotated according to the parameters that guided their selection, which would undoubtedly contribute to the systematization and automatization of the process. First, the images included in EcoLexicon were analyzed in terms of their adequateness, the semantic relations expressed, the concept types and their VKPs. Then, with these data, guidelines for image selection and annotation were created. The final aim is twofold: (1) to systematize the selection of images and (2) to start annotating old and new images so that the system can automatically allocate them in different concept entries based on shared conceptual propositions."
Karin KipperAnna KorhonenNeville RyantMartha Palmer,Language Resources and Evaluation,a large scale classification of english verbs,2008,"Lexical classifications have proved useful in supporting various natural language processing (NLP) tasks. The largest verb classification for English is Levin’s (1993) work which defines groupings of verbs based on syntactic and semantic properties. VerbNet (VN) (Kipper et al. 2000; Kipper-Schuler 2005)—an extensive computational verb lexicon for English—provides detailed syntactic-semantic descriptions of Levin classes. While the classes included are extensive enough for some NLP use, they are not comprehensive. Korhonen and Briscoe (2004) have proposed a significant extension of Levin’s classification which incorporates 57 novel classes for verbs not covered (comprehensively) by Levin. Korhonen and Ryant (unpublished) have recently proposed another extension including 53 additional classes. This article describes the integration of these two extensions into VN. The result is a comprehensive Levin-style classification for English verbs providing over 90% token coverage of the Proposition Bank data (Palmer et al. 2005) and thus can be highly useful for practical applications."

Muhua ZhuJingbo ZhuHuizhen Wang,Language Resources and Evaluation,a feature based approach to better automatic treebank conversion,2013,"In the field of constituency parsing, there exist multiple human-labeled treebanks which are built on non-overlapping text samples and follow different annotation standards. Due to the extreme cost of annotating parse trees by human, it is desirable to automatically convert one treebank (called source treebank) to the standard of another treebank (called target treebank) which we are interested in. Conversion results can be manually corrected to obtain higher-quality annotations or can be directly used as additional training data for building syntactic parsers. To perform automatic treebank conversion, we divide constituency parses into two separate levels: the part-of-speech (POS) and syntactic structure (bracketing structures and constituent labels), and conduct conversion on these two levels respectively with a feature-based approach. The basic idea of the approach is to encode original annotations in a source treebank as guide features during the conversion process. Experiments on two Chinese treebanks show that our approach can convert POS tags and syntactic structures with the accuracy of 96.6 and 84.8 %, respectively, which are the best reported results on this task."

The morphological tagging model is based on the averaged structured perceptron classifier. Given training data, new taggers are estimated in a computationally efficient manner using a combination of beam search and model cascade. The lemmatization is performed employing a combination of a rule-based morphological analyzer, OMorFi, and a data-driven lemmatization model. The toolkit is readily applicable for tagging and lemmatization of running text with models learned from the recently published Finnish Turku Dependency Treebank and FinnTreeBank. Empirical evaluation on these corpora shows that FinnPos performs favorably compared to reference systems in terms of tagging and lemmatization accuracy. In addition, we demonstrate that our system is highly competitive with regard to computational efficiency of learning new models and assigning analyses to novel sentences."

The Text Encoding Initiative (TEI), was launched in 1987 and sponsored by the Association for Computers and the Humanities, the Association for Literary and Linguistic Computing, and the Association for Computational Linguistics. It had as its original objective the development of an interchange language for textual data. This effort was completely successful and the TEI Guidelines are now widely accepted as the standard interchange format for textual data. Mylonas and Renear also note that the TEI has accomplished two other major achievements: it has produced a powerful new data description language (which is influencing the development of new WWW standards); and, most importantly, it has motivated the development of an entirely new research community, focused on understanding the role of text structure and markup in the use of emerging information technologies in culture, scholarship, and communication."

Dialogue systems are an integrated part of our daily life. They generally mean simplicity, time saving and safety. For example, when driving, hand-free operations are necessary and therefore the possibility of giving commands through speech is a necessity. However, to implement more flexible dialogue systems, it is important that these systems can adapt to the speaker. In particular, it seems very important that dialogue systems should be able to recognize and cope with our emotions. To human, the emotions recognition process occurs in an automatic, unconscious, and effortless fashion. Emotions explicitly affect our autonomic nervous system (e.g., cardiovascular and skin conductance changes) and our somatic nervous system (motor expression in face, voice and body).

To deal with this problem, we propose a method which automatically constructs a term resource specific to the document collection and then applies the resource to document re-ranking. The term resource includes a list of terms extracted from the documents as well as their weighting and correlations computed after initial retrieval. The term weighting based on local and global distribution ensures the re-ranking not sensitive to different choices of pseudo relevance, while the term correlation helps avoid any bias to certain specific concept embedded in queries. Experiments with NTCIR3 data show that the approach can not only improve performance of initial retrieval, but also make significant contribution to standard query expansion."

In this paper, some AWN shortcomings related to coverage and usability are addressed. The use of AWN in question/answering (Q/A) helped us to deeply evaluate the resource from an experience-based perspective. Accordingly, an enrichment of AWN was built by semi-automatically extending its content. Indeed, existing approaches and/or resources developed for other languages were adapted and used for AWN. The experiments conducted in Arabic Q/A have shown an improvement of both AWN coverage as well as usability. Concerning coverage, a great amount of named entities extracted from YAGO were connected with corresponding AWN synsets. Also, a significant number of new verbs and nouns (including Broken Plural forms) were added. In terms of usability, thanks to the use of AWN, the performance for the AWN-based Q/A application registered an overall improvement with respect to the following three measures: accuracy (+9.27 % improvement), mean reciprocal rank (+3.6 improvement) and number of answered questions (+12.79 % improvement)."

A user of the retrieval system enters the principal parts of the search term (two parts for a noun or adjective, three parts for a deponent verb, and four parts for other verbs), this enabling the identification of the type of word that is to be processed and of the rules that are to be followed in determining the morphological variants that should be retrieved. Two different search algorithms are described. The algorithms are applied to the Latin portion of the Hartlib Papers Collection and to a range of classical, vulgar and medieval Latin texts drawn from the Patrologia Latina and from the PHI Disk 5.3 datasets. The effectiveness of these searches demonstrates the effectiveness of our procedures in providing access to the full range of classical and post-classical Latin text databases."

Philip D. Gillis,Computers and the Humanities,using computer technology to teach and evaluate prewriting,1987,"The purpose of this research was to determine whether computer-aided instruction may be effectively utilized in stimulating prewriting composition when the CAI is based upon (1) conceptual (cognitive) strategies, (2) “data-driven” guidance (resulting from CAE techniques), and (3) recent findings in tutorial strategies research. If this specifically designed CAI is as good a means of prewriting instruction as personal tutoring and a better means than classroom instruction, then the practical and economical implications may be weighed in a decision to use such techniques. Forty-three college freshmen in three basic writing classes participated in this study. One class was exposed to a CAI medium, the other two either to a human tutor or to classroom instruction. A computer-aided evaluation of previous essays provided focus, and other intellectual processing cues provided information on an expository topic; this “database” was then used to construct a CAI program to encourage “specificity” and “depth of intellectual processing“ in students' prewriting composition. The program also possessed and was designed to provide “conceptual guidance” through the use of five heuristic procedures; thus it contained two key elements that a human tutor would possess in working with a topic—knowledge of the topic, and a means for eliciting that knowledge from the tutee. The second treatment method used consisted of instruction by human tutors, utilizing the same methodology. The control for the study consisted of a classroom instruction group. Results showed the CAI group demonstrating gains in every category of measurement utilized in this study, and its performances was significantly better than both the tutorial group on two of the post-test measures. The CAI group was superior, through not significantly, on post-test performances in every category used in the study except fluency."

Nikita Astrakhantsev,Language Resources and Evaluation,atr4s toolkit with state of the art automatic terms recognition methods in scala,2018,"Automatically recognized terminology is widely used for various domain-specific texts processing tasks, such as machine translation, information retrieval or ontology construction. However, there is still no agreement on which methods are best suited for particular settings and, moreover, there is no reliable comparison of already developed methods. We believe that one of the main reasons is the lack of state-of-the-art method implementations, which are usually non-trivial to recreate—mostly, in terms of software engineering efforts. In order to address these issues, we present ATR4S, an open-source software written in Scala that comprises 13 state-of-the-art methods for automatic terminology recognition (ATR) and implements the whole pipeline from text document preprocessing, to term candidates collection, term candidate scoring, and finally, term candidate ranking. It is highly scalable, modular and configurable tool with support of automatic caching. We also compare 13 state-of-the-art methods on 7 open datasets by average precision and processing time. Experimental comparison reveals that no single method demonstrates best average precision for all datasets and that other available tools for ATR do not contain the best methods."
Branimir BoguraevMary Neff,Language Resources and Evaluation,a framework for traversing dense annotation lattices,2010,"Pattern matching, or querying, over annotations is a general purpose paradigm for inspecting, navigating, mining, and transforming annotation repositories—the common representation basis for modern pipelined text processing architectures. The open-ended nature of these architectures and expressiveness of feature structure-based annotation schemes account for the natural tendency of such annotation repositories to become very dense, as multiple levels of analysis get encoded as layered annotations. This particular characteristic presents challenges for the design of a pattern matching framework capable of interpreting ‘flat’ patterns over arbitrarily dense annotation lattices. We present an approach where a finite state device applies (compiled) pattern grammars over what is, in effect, a linearized ‘projection’ of a particular route through the lattice. The route is derived by a mix of static grammar analysis and runtime interpretation of navigational directives within an extended grammar formalism; it selects just the annotations sequence appropriate for the patterns at hand. For expressive and efficient pattern matching in dense annotations stores, our implemented approach achieves a mix of lattice traversal and finite state scanning by exposing a language which, to its user, provides constructs for specifying sequential, structural, and configurational constraints among annotations."

RTMs pioneer a language-independent approach to all similarity tasks and remove the need to access any task- or domain-specific information or resource. We use RTMs for predicting the semantic similarity of text and present state-of-the-art results showing that RTMs can achieve better results on the test set than on the training set. Interpretants are used to derive features measuring the closeness of the test sentences to the training data, the difficulty of translating them, and the presence of the acts of translation, which may ubiquitously be observed in communication. RTMs can achieve top performance at SemEval in various semantic similarity prediction tasks as well as similarity prediction tasks in bilingual settings. We obtain rankings of various prediction tasks using the performance of RTM and relative evaluation metrics, which can help identify which tasks and subtasks require more work by design."
Zornitsa KozarevaEduard Hovy,Language Resources and Evaluation,tailoring the automated construction of large scale taxonomies using the web,2013,"It has long been a dream to have available a single, centralized, semantic thesaurus or terminology taxonomy to support research in a variety of fields. Much human and computational effort has gone into constructing such resources, including the original WordNet and subsequent wordnets in various languages. To produce such resources one has to overcome well-known problems in achieving both wide coverage and internal consistency within a single wordnet and across many wordnets. In particular, one has to ensure that alternative valid taxonomizations covering the same basic terms are recognized and treated appropriately. In this paper we describe a pipeline of new, powerful, minimally supervised, automated algorithms that can be used to construct terminology taxonomies and wordnets, in various languages, by harvesting large amounts of online domain-specific or general text. We illustrate the effectiveness of the algorithms both to build localized, domain-specific wordnets and to highlight and investigate certain deeper ontological problems such as parallel generalization hierarchies. We show shortcomings and gaps in the manually-constructed English WordNet in various domains."

Besides introducing each step of ECO, we report on how it was implemented to create Onto.PT, a public lexical ontology for Portuguese. Onto.PT is the result of the automatic exploitation of Portuguese dictionaries and thesauri, and it aims to minimise the main limitations of existing Portuguese lexical knowledge bases."

Rather than a direct conversion from dependency trees to CCG trees, we propose a two stage approach: a language independent generic algorithm first extracts a CCG lexicon from the dependency treebank. An exhaustive CCG parser then creates a treebank of CCG derivations. We also discuss special cases of this generic algorithm to handle linguistic phenomena specific to Hindi. In doing so we extract different constructions with long-range dependencies like coordinate constructions and non-projective dependencies resulting from constructions like relative clauses, noun elaboration and verbal modifiers."

This serves to set WSDapart and puts limits on its effectiveness as an independent NLP task.Moreover, it is argued that current WSD methods based on very small wordsamples are also potentially misleading because they may or may not scaleup. Since all-word WSD methods are now available and are producing figurescomparable to the smaller scale tasks, it is argued that we shouldconcentrate on the former and find ways of bootstrapping test materialsfor such tests in the future."
Markéta LopatkováPetr HomolaNatalia Klyueva,Language Resources and Evaluation,annotation of sentence structure,2012,"The focus of this article is on the creation of a collection of sentences manually annotated with respect to their sentence structure. We show that the concept of linear segments—linguistically motivated units, which may be easily detected automatically—serves as a good basis for the identification of clauses in Czech. The segment annotation captures such relationships as subordination, coordination, apposition and parenthesis; based on segmentation charts, individual clauses forming a complex sentence are identified. The annotation of a sentence structure enriches a dependency-based framework with explicit syntactic information on relations among complex units like clauses. We have gathered a collection of 3,444 sentences from the Prague Dependency Treebank, which were annotated with respect to their sentence structure (these sentences comprise 10,746 segments forming 6,341 clauses). The main purpose of the project is to gain a development data—promising results for Czech NLP tools (as a dependency parser or a machine translation system for related languages) that adopt an idea of clause segmentation have been already reported. The collection of sentences with annotated sentence structure provides the possibility of further improvement of such tools."
Jimmy LinG. Craig MurrayBonnie J.

Translation of such resources into multiple languages is an important component for providing multilingual access. However, the specificity of vocabulary terms in most thesauri precludes fully-automatic translation using general-domain lexical resources. In this paper, we present an efficient process for leveraging human translations to construct domain-specific lexical resources. This process is illustrated on a thesaurus of 56,000 concepts used to catalog a large archive of oral histories. We elicited human translations on a small subset of concepts, induced a probabilistic phrase dictionary from these translations, and used the resulting resource to automatically translate the rest of the thesaurus. Two separate evaluations demonstrate the acceptability of the automatic translations and the cost-effectiveness of our approach."

These improvements are now available to all the project grammars."

As part of improving surveillance in the region, the BioCaster project aims to develop a system based on text mining for automatically monitoring Internet news and other online sources in several regional languages. At the heart of the system is an application ontology which serves the dual purpose of enabling advanced searches on the mined facts and of allowing the system to make intelligent inferences for assessing the priority of events. However, it became clear early on in the project that existing classification schemes did not have the necessary language coverage or semantic specificity for our needs. In this article we present an overview of our needs and explore in detail the rationale and methods for developing a new conceptual structure and multilingual terminological resource that focusses on priority pathogens and the diseases they cause.

Although most of the constants for lexical richness actually depend on text length, Yule’s characteristic is considered to be highly reliable for being text length independent. It is not the aim of this paper questioning the validity of K to measure the lexical repeat-rate, nor to evaluate its usefulness in authorship studies, but to review the most accurate procedure to calculate its value in the light of the lack of standardization found in the specific literature. At the same time, the peculiar calculation of Yule’s K by TACT is explained. Our study suggests that standardization will certainly help improve the studies where K is employed."

A synset consists of words. Synonymy is a relation between words. Words go into a synset because they are synonyms. Later, a wordnet treats words as synonymous because they belong in the same synset\(\ldots\) Such circularity, a well-known problem, poses a practical difficulty in wordnet construction, notably when it comes to maintaining consistency. We propose to make a wordnet a net of words or, to be more precise, lexical units. We discuss our assumptions and present their implementation in a steadily growing Polish wordnet. A small set of constitutive relations allows us to construct synsets automatically out of groups of lexical units with the same connectivity. Our analysis includes a thorough comparative overview of systems of relations in several influential wordnets. The additional synset-forming mechanisms include stylistic registers and verb aspect."

W. van Peer,Computers and the Humanities,quantitative studies of literature a critique and an outlook,1989,"The present paper is a critique of quantitative studies of literature. It is argued that such studies are involved in an act of reification, in which, moreover, fundamental ingredients of the texts, e.g. their (highly important) range of figurative meanings, are eliminated from the analysis. Instead a concentration on lower levels of linguistic organization, such as grammar and lexis, may be observed, in spite of the fact that these are often the least relevant aspects of the text. In doing so, quantitative studies of literature significantly reduce not only the cultural value of texts, but also the generalizability of its own findings. What is needed, therefore, is an awareness and readiness to relate to matters of textuality as an organizing principle underlying the cultural functioning of literary works of art."

Still, questions remain about where and how it can be useful. It is not terribly useful on final versions of good prose; the makers assert that it is more useful on unedited prose, where there are many inadvertent errors. An empirical study of much unedited prose would not only verify this assertion, but would help improve the program."
Philippe Fleury,Computers and the Humanities,du texte latin la concordance imprime,1986,"The development of the technique of laser printing opens new ways for the writing of concordances to Latin texts, by means of electronic data processing. It is indeed possible to obtain as good a quality of printing as with traditional typography, even for a very important number of characters, which is always the case with concordances. A first step to obtaining perfection in the format of the final document consists in collecting data carefully and programming the software so as to provide scholars with a tool that will really facilitate their researches. Although the cutting out of the “useful context” is a very difficult problem to solve when using computers, as many data (punctuation, capital letters, diacritic signs...) as possible can be collected from the very beginning. These data will then make the text provided for each keyword more comprehensible. The programming must obviously be improved to take all the collected data into account. The reader of a concordance produced in such a way will have at his disposal a text easy to read not only because of its typographic quality, but also because of all its information on reference, punctuation, lemma, manuscript tradition; also he will be able to find in appendices pertinent frequency lists, lists of names and all sorts of lexical, morphological, syntactical information according to the work involved in the data collecting and programming."

The measures chosen give evidence of a strong and consistent difference between the groups, going beyond historical changes in the language. The Romantic tragedies are more expository; the Renaissance ones include more commonplace interactions between characters. The later plays do not show the marked variations in function-word frequencies of their predecessors. Of the Renaissance plays, Shakespeare's show the closest affinity to the Romantic tragedies, and the most telling contrasts."

It is noted that teaching computing to humanities students appears to be viewed with suspicion by some Computer Science and Humanities Departments. The two camps seem to fear, for different reasons, that issues and practices important to their disciplines will be compromised or watered down. This paper describes an attempt to reverse any such attitudes on the part of staff and students and to take undergraduates considerably beyond mere word processing and computer literacy. Various methods and techniques used in the course are presented and their value assessed. The importance of using a consistent computer interface to helping students form a stable conceptual model of computers is considered. We reflect on the value of teaching more about Human Computer Interaction and Artificial Intelligence than is usual in Humanities Computing courses. A number of lessons are drawn from the course."

In recent years scholars have pointed out a few obvious examples of sound symbolism inKokinshû poetry.

Fiona J. TweedieR. Harald Baayen,Computers and the Humanities,how variable may a constant be measures of lexical richness in perspective,1998,"A well-known problem in the domain of quantitative linguistics and stylistics concerns the evaluation of the lexical richness of texts. Since the most obvious measure of lexical richness, the vocabulary size (the number of different word types), depends heavily on the text length (measured in word tokens), a variety of alternative measures has been proposed which are claimed to be independent of the text length. This paper has a threefold aim. Firstly, we have investigated to what extent these alternative measures are truly textual constants. We have observed that in practice all measures vary substantially and systematically with the text length. We also show that in theory, only three of these measures are truly constant or nearly constant. Secondly, we have studied the extent to which these measures tap into different aspects of lexical structure. We have found that there are two main families of constants, one measuring lexical richness and one measuring lexical repetition. Thirdly, we have considered to what extent these measures can be used to investigate questions of textual similarity between and within authors. We propose to carry out such comparisons by means of the empirical trajectories of texts in the plane spanned by the dimensions of lexical richness and lexical repetition, and we provide a statistical technique for constructing confidence intervals around the empirical trajectories of texts. Our results suggest that the trajectories tap into a considerable amount of authorial structure without, however, guaranteeing that spatial separation implies a difference in authorship."

Burton,Computers and the Humanities,computer applications in cultural anthropology,1970,"This paper covers important developments in the use of computers for quantitative research in cultural anthropology, particularly in areas which (unlike statistics) are uniquely anthropological. These fall into statistical topics and topics in scaling and measurement. By far the largest single usage of computers by cultural anthropologists is for statistical summaries of field data and for simple statistical tests such as thechi-squared for the analysis of field data or for cross-cultural studies. As the discipline develops this situation will remain the same. In fact, the proportion of people who use the computer primarily for contingency tables, frequency counts, and correlation analysis may very well increase, since there are many potential users who would fall in this category and only a few potential users who would perform other operations such as multi-dimensional scaling or simulation. The few other computer techniques that would be relevant to anthropology, and for which the technology already exists, include linear regression, as practiced by economists, and linear programming (also practiced by economists), both of which could be extremely useful in the study of peasant economy. Careful research with such models could dispel some of the controversy which has been hindering the development of economic anthropology for the last fifteen years. The training of anthropologists who can understand the relevance of such models to their work may be far in the future, since the majority of them are still skeptical of most formal methods and of the computers which make them work."

These references can be specific (e.g. C sharp in the treble clef) or general (fugal passage, Thor’s Hammer). Experts can usually identify the features in question in music scores but a means of performing this task automatically could be very useful for experts and beginners alike. Following work on textual question answering over many years as co-organisers of the QA tasks at the Cross Language Evaluation Forum, we decided in 2013 to propose a new type of task where the input would be a natural language phrase, together with a music score in MusicXML, and the required output would be one or more matching passages in the score. We report here on 3 years of the C@merata task at MediaEval. We describe the design of the task, the evaluation methods we devised for it, the approaches adopted by participant systems and the results obtained. Finally, we assess the progress which has been made in aligning natural language text with music and map out the main steps for the future.

Editions published to date do not separate the explorer's narrative from that of his transcriber or editor. Since style can influence readers' perceptions of a writer's personality, it is important to determine characteristics of writing attributed to Columbus that may pertain instead to his trascriber. This study employs the computer to explore the style of Las Casas and that of Columbus. Differences in the writing of each “author” emerge with computer assistance by isolating Columbus' words from those of his transcriber and analyzing selected features of vocabulary, sentence length, and syntax.1"
Gregor WiedemannGerhard Heyer,Language Resources and Evaluation,multi modal page stream segmentation with convolutional neural networks,2019,"In recent years, (retro-)digitizing paper-based files became a major undertaking for private and public archives as well as an important task in electronic mailroom applications. As first steps, the workflow usually involves batch scanning and optical character recognition (OCR) of documents. In the case of multi-page documents, the preservation of document contexts is a major requirement. To facilitate workflows involving very large amounts of paper scans, page stream segmentation (PSS) is the task to automatically separate a stream of scanned images into coherent multi-page documents. In a digitization project together with a German federal archive, we developed a novel approach for PSS based on convolutional neural networks (CNN). As a first project, we combine visual information from scanned images with semantic information from OCR-ed texts for this task. The multi-modal combination of features in a single classification architecture allows for major improvements towards optimal document separation. Further to multimodality, our PSS approach profits from transfer-learning and sequential page modeling. We achieve accuracy up to 95% on multi-page documents on our in-house dataset and up to 93% on a publicly available dataset."

P.

The first is pre-coding of the text, in this instance the poetry of P. Valéry, in accordance with taxonomic grids enumerating the typical patterns followed by the syntagm to be analyzed. From a strictly mathematical point of view, there are too many possible combinations (several thousand), and the number of typical patterns is therefore reduced as much as possible.

Matej RojcHarald HögeZdravko Kačič,Language Resources and Evaluation,remote based text to speech modules evaluation framework the res framework,2010,"The ECESS consortium (European Center of Excellence in Speech Synthesis) aims to speed up progress in speech synthesis technology, by providing an appropriate evaluation framework. The key element of the evaluation framework is based on the partition of a text-to-speech synthesis system into distributed TTS modules. A text processing, prosody generation, and an acoustic synthesis module have been specified currently. A split into various modules has the advantage that the developers of an institution active in ECESS, can concentrate its efforts on a single module, and test its performance in a complete system using missing modules from the developers of other institutions. In this way, complete TTS systems can be built using high performance modules from different institutions. In order to evaluate the modules and to connect modules efficiently, a remote evaluation platform—the Remote Evaluation System (RES) based on the existing internet infrastructure—has been developed within ECESS. The RES is based on client–server architecture. It consists of RES module servers, which encapsulate the modules of the developers, a RES client, which sends data to and receives data from the RES module servers, and a RES server, which connects the RES module servers, and organizes the flow of information. RES can be used by developers for selecting RES module from the internet, which contains a missing TTS module needed to test and improve the performances of their own modules. Finally, the RES allows for the evaluation of TTS modules running at different institutions worldwide. When using the RES client, the institution performing the evaluation is able to set-up and performs various evaluation tasks by sending test data via the RES client and receiving results from the RES module servers. Currently ELDA www.elda.org is setting-up an evaluation using the RES client, which will then be extended to an evaluation client specializing in the envisaged evaluation tasks."

We present an elaborate user evaluation study to determine human preferences in forum summarization and to create a reference data set. We showed long threads to ten different raters and asked them to create a summary by selecting the posts that they considered to be the most important for the thread. We study the agreement between human raters on the summarization task, and we show how multiple reference summaries can be combined to develop a successful model for automatic summarization. We found that although the inter-rater agreement for the summarization task was slight to fair, the automatic summarizer obtained reasonable results in terms of precision, recall, and ROUGE. Moreover, when human raters were asked to choose between the summary created by another human and the summary created by our model in a blind side-by-side comparison, they judged the model’s summary equal to or better than the human summary in over half of the cases. This shows that even for a summarization task with low inter-rater agreement, a model can be trained that generates sensible summaries. In addition, we investigated the potential for personalized summarization. However, the results for the three raters involved in this experiment were inconclusive. We release the reference summaries as a publicly available dataset."

It is been used in applications such as information retrieval, machine translation, and text summarization, as their pre-processing step to increase efficiency. Currently, there are a few stemming algorithms which have been developed for languages such as English, Arabic, Turkish, Malay and Amharic. Unfortunately, no algorithm has been used to stem text in Hausa, a Chadic language spoken in West Africa. To address this need, we propose stemming Hausa text using affix-stripping rules and reference lookup. We stemmed Hausa text, using 78 affix stripping rules applied in 4 steps and a reference look-up consisting of 1500 Hausa root words. The over-stemming index, under-stemming index, stemmer weight, word stemmed factor, correctly stemmed words factor and average words conflation factor were calculated to determine the effect of reference look-up on the strength and accuracy of the stemmer. It was observed that reference look-up aided in reducing both over-stemming and under-stemming errors, increased accuracy and has a tendency to reduce the strength of an affix stripping stemmer. The rationality behind the approach used is discussed and directions for future research are identified."
Kurt WinklerTobias Kuhn,Language Resources and Evaluation,fully automatic multi language translation with a catalogue of phrases successful employment for the swiss avalanche bulletin,2017,"The Swiss avalanche bulletin is produced twice a day in four languages. Due to the lack of time available for manual translation, a fully automated translation system is employed, based on a catalogue of predefined phrases and predetermined rules of how these phrases can be combined to produce sentences. Because this catalogue of phrases is limited to a small sublanguage, the system is able to automatically translate such sentences from German into the target languages French, Italian and English without subsequent proofreading or correction. Having been operational for two winter seasons, we assess here the quality of the produced texts based on two different surveys where participants rated texts from real avalanche bulletins from both origins, the catalogue of phrases versus manually written and translated texts. With a mean recognition rate of 55 %, users can hardly distinguish between the two types of texts, and give very similar ratings with respect to their language quality. Overall, the output from the catalogue system can be considered virtually equivalent to a text written by avalanche forecasters and then manually translated by professional translators. Furthermore, forecasters declared that all relevant situations were captured by the system with sufficient accuracy. Forecaster’s working load did not change with the introduction of the catalogue: the extra time to find matching sentences is compensated by the fact that they no longer need to double-check manually translated texts. The reduction of daily translation costs is expected to offset the initial development costs within a few years."

The LTAG-spinal Treebank makes explicit semantic relations that are implicit or absent from the original PTB. LTAG-spinal provides a very desirable resource for statistical LTAG parsing, incremental parsing, dependency parsing, and semantic parsing. This treebank has been successfully used to train an incremental LTAG-spinal parser and a bidirectional LTAG dependency parser."

Oi Yee Kwong,Language Resources and Evaluation,the potentials and limitations of modelling concept concreteness in computational semantic lexicons with dictionary definitions,2013,"This paper explores the feasibility of modelling concept concreteness perceived by humans and representing it in computational semantic lexicons, addressing an issue at the crossroads of computational linguistics, lexicography, and psycholinguistics. The inherent distinction between concrete words and abstract words in psychology has relied mostly on subjective human ratings. This practice is hardly scalable and does not consider the effect of polysemy. In view of this, we attempt to obtain a measure of concreteness from dictionary definitions comparable to human judgement, capitalising on conventional lexicographic assumptions and the regularities exhibited in the surface structures of sense definitions. The structural pattern of a definition is analysed and scored on a 7-point scale of concreteness ratings. The definition scores turned out to be quite effective for a dichotomous distinction between concrete and abstract concepts and more consistent with human ratings for the former. Beyond the two-way distinction, however, the results were more variable. The study has thus revealed the potentials and limitations of our approach, suggesting that different defining styles probably reflect the describability of concepts, and describability alone may not be sufficient for differentiating the degree of concreteness. The range of definition patterns has to be reconsidered, in combination with other inseparable factors constituting our perception of concreteness, for better modelling on a finer scale of concreteness distinction to enrich semantic lexicons for natural language processing."

The application of interest in DICIT is a distant-talking interface for control of interactive TV working in a typical living room, with many interfering devices. The objective of the experiments was to collect a database supporting efficient development and tuning of acoustic processing algorithms for signal enhancement. In DICIT, techniques for sound source localization, multichannel acoustic echo cancellation, blind source separation, speech activity detection, speaker identification and verification as well as beamforming are combined to achieve a maximum possible reduction of the user speech impairments typical of distant-talking interfaces. The collected database permitted to simulate at preliminary stage a realistic scenario and to tailor the involved algorithms to the observed user behaviors. In order to match the project requirements, the WOZ experiments were recorded in three languages: English, German and Italian. Besides the user inputs, the database also contains non-speech related acoustic events, room impulse response measurements and video data, the latter used to compute three-dimensional positions of each subject. Sessions were manually transcribed and segmented at word level, introducing also specific labels for acoustic events."

An ontology is a formalized system of concepts (potentially of a specific domain) and the relations these concepts entertain. A lexicon, on the other hand, is the language component that contains the conventionalized knowledge of natural language speakers about lexical items (mostly words, but also morphemes and idioms). Ontologies ‘operate’ on the conceptual level, lexicons on the linguistic level. Ontologies systematize and relate concepts, lexicons systematize and relate words and other lexical items. However, as semantic relations between lexical items reflect meaning relatedness and meaning is essentially conceptual, both notions appear to be very close to one another (and are often wrongly used interchangeably). The interplay of and mapping between ontologies and lexical resources is therefore a vital and challenging field of research, one which has gained additional momentum and importance..."
Rosie JonesKevin BartzPero SubasicBenjamin Rey,Language Resources and Evaluation,automatically generating related queries in japanese,2006,"Web searchers reformulate their queries, as they adapt to search engine behavior, learn more about a topic, or simply correct typing errors. Automatic query rewriting can help user web search, by augmenting a user’s query, or replacing the query with one likely to retrieve better results. One example of query-rewriting is spell-correction. We may also be interested in changing words to synonyms or other related terms. For Japanese, the opportunities for improving results are greater than for languages with a single character set, since documents may be written in multiple character sets, and a user may express the same meaning using different character sets. We give a description of the characteristics of Japanese search query logs and manual query reformulations carried out by Japanese web searchers. We use characteristics of Japanese query reformulations to extend previous work on automatic query rewriting in English, taking into account the Japanese writing system. We introduce several new features for building models resulting from this difference and discuss their impact on automatic query rewriting. We also examine enhancements in the form of rules which block conversion between some character sets, to address Japanese homophones. The precision/recall curves show significant improvement with the new feature set and blocking rules, and are often better than the English counterpart."

Hence a technology audit was conducted for the South African HLT landscape, to create a systematic and detailed inventory of the status of the HLT components across the eleven official languages. Based on the Basic Language Resource Kit (BLaRK) framework Krauwer (ELRA Newslett 3(2), 1998), we used various data collection methods (such as focus groups, questionnaires and personal consultations with HLT experts) to gather detailed information. The South African HLT landscape is analysed using a number of complementary approaches and based on the interpretations of the results, recommendations are made on how to accelerate HLT development in South Africa, as well as on how to conduct similar audits in other countries and contexts."

It is a problem of knowledge representation as defined in the field of artificial intelligence. Instead of a purely theoretical discussion of the issue, we present selected results of a practical experiment which has in itself some theoretical significance. We show how one can represent different philosophies using CODE, a knowledge engineering system developed by artificial intelligence researchers. The hypothesis is that such a computer based representation of philosophical systems can give insight into their conceptual structure. We argue that computer aided text analysis can apply knowledge representation tools and techniques developed in artificial intelligence and we estimate how philosophers as well as knowledge engineers could gain from this cross-fertilization. This paper should be considered as an experiment report on the use of knowledge representation techniques in computer aided text analysis. It is part of a much broader project on the representation of conceptual structures in an expert system. However, we intentionally avoided technical issues related to either Computer Science or History of Philosophy to focus on the benefit to enhance traditional humanistic studies with tools and methods developed in AI on the one hand and the need to develop more appropriate tools on the other."

Mark Olsen,Computers and the Humanities,signs symbols and discourses a new direction for computer aided literature studies,1993,"Computer-aided literature studies have failed to have a significant impact on the field as a whole. This failure is traced to a concentration on how a text achieves its literary effect by the examination of subtle semantic or grammatical structures in single texts or the works of individual authors. Computer systems have proven to be very poorly suited to such refined analysis of complex language. Adopting such traditional objects of study has tended to discourage researchers from using the tool to ask questions to which it is better adapted, the examination of large amounts of simple linguistic features. Theoreticians such as Barthes, Foucault and Halliday show the importance of determining the linguistic and semantic characteristics of the language used by the author and her/his audience. Current technology, and databases like the TLG or ARTFL, facilitate such wide-spectrum analyses. Computer-aided methods are thus capable of opening up new areas of study, which can potentially transform the way in which literature is studied."

Standard measures of lexical richness, Yule's K andOrlov's Z both distinguish Adair from Carroll, though Z also distinguishesthe two originals.

OM has a rich set of applications, ranging from tracking users' opinions about products or about political candidates as expressed in online forums, to customer relationship management. In order to aid the extraction of opinions from text, recent research has tried to automatically determine the “PN-polarity” of subjective terms, i.e. identify whether a term that indicates the presence of an opinion has a positive or a negative connotation. Research on determining the “SO-polarity” of terms, i.e. whether a term indeed indicates the presence of an opinion (a subjective term) or not (an objective, or neutral term) has been instead much scarcer. In this paper we describe SentiWordNet, a lexical resource produced by asking an automated classifier ˆ to associate to each synset s of WordNet (version 2.0) a triplet of scores ˆ(s, p) (for p 2 P ={\{}Positive, Negative, Objective{\}}) describing how strongly the terms contained in s enjoy each of the three properties. The method used to develop SentiWordNet is based on the quantitative analysis of the glosses associated to synsets, and on the use of the resulting vectorial term representations for semi-supervised synset classification. The score triplet is derived by combining the results produced by a committee of eight ternary classifiers, all characterized by similar accuracy levels but extremely different classification behaviour. We present the results of evaluating the accuracy of the automatically assigned triplets on a publicly available benchmark.

To avoid the tedious task of measuring confounding effects, scientists often refer to normative sets of stimuli. The Bank of Standardized Stimuli (BOSS) is one of these sets. It initially included 480 normative stimuli of common objects and norms for seven variables (name, category, familiarity, visual complexity, object's typicality, manipulability and orientation). The BOSS has expanded and provides a wider variety of stimuli in order to fulfill the needs of experiments. To date, the latest version of the BOSS is comprised of 1,420 normative stimuli, including photos of animals, and new norms (color diagnositicity, symmetry, and action related norms). In order to demonstrate the influence of normative variables on cognitions, experiments on episodic memory were completed using the BOSS. Analyses were conducted as a function of the norms and indicated that name agreement, visual complexity, object/viewpoint agreement, symmetry, and color diagnosticity all influenced memory in distinct ways mostly by affecting the performance to new stimuli and by inducing response biases."

However, no ratings for older adults are available. The aim of the present study was to close this gap by providing ratings of valence and arousal for 504 IAPS pictures by 53 young and 53 older adults. Both age groups rated positive pictures as less arousing, resulting in a stronger linear association between valence and arousal, than has been found in previous studies. This association was even stronger in older than in young adults. Older adults perceived negative pictures as more negative and more arousing and positive pictures as more positive and less arousing than young adults did. This might indicate a dedifferentiation of emotional processing in old age. On the basis of a picture recognition task, we also report memorability scores for individual pictures and how they relate to valence and arousal ratings.

Disentangling morphology from phonology and semantics is often a methodological challenge, because orthogonal manipulations are difficult to achieve (e.g., semantically unrelated words are often phonologically related: casual-casualty and, vice versa, sign-signal). The present norms provide a morphological classification of 3,263 suffixed derived words from two widely spoken languages: English (2,204 words) and Spanish (1,059 words). Morphologically complex words were sorted into four categories according to the nature of their relationship with the base word: phonologically transparent (friend-friendly), phonologically opaque (child-children), semantically transparent (habit-habitual), and semantically opaque (event-eventual). In addition, ratings were gathered for age of acquisition, imageability, and semantic distance (i.e., the extent to which the meaning of the complex derived form could be drawn from the meaning of its base constituents). The norms were completed by adding values for word frequency; word length in number of phonemes, letters, and syllables; lexical similarity, as measured by the number of neighbors; and morphological family size. A series of comparative analyses from the collated ratings for the base and derived words were also carried out. The results are discussed in relation to recent findings."

Use of existing results from this paradigm can be limited by the precision of the data and the need for cross-experiment comparisons that lack normal experimental controls. Here, we present a single, large, high-precision, multicondition experiment to address these problems. Over 1,000 participants from 14 sites responded to 840 trials involving 28 different types of orthographically related primes (e.g., castfe-CASTLE) in a lexical decision task, as well as completing measures of spelling and vocabulary.

This article presents the method of data collection and preliminary findings from these data, which included replications of the most widely agreed-upon differences between prime types, further evidence for systematic individual differences in susceptibility to priming, and new evidence regarding lexical properties associated with a target word's susceptibility to priming. These analyses will form a basis for the use of these data in quantitative model fitting and evaluation and for future exploration of these data that will inform and motivate new experiments."

In the original article, there was an error in the second sentence of Footnote 3 on page 175. The corrected sentence is present in the erratum.] The body-shape-related stimuli used in most body-image studies have several limitations (e.g., a lack of pilot validation procedures and the use of non-body-shape-related control/neutral stimuli). We therefore developed a database of 61 computer-generated body-only pictures of women, wherein bodies were methodically manipulated in terms of fatness versus thinness. Eighty-two young women assessed the pictures' attractiveness, beauty, harmony (valence ratings), and body shape (assessed on a thinness/fatness axis), providing normative data for valence and body shape ratings. First, stimuli manipulated for fatness versus thinness conveyed comparable emotional intensities regarding the valence and body shape ratings. Second, different subcategories of stimuli were obtained on the basis of variations in body shape and valence judgments. Fat and thin bodies were distributed into several subcategories depending on their valence ratings, and a subcategory containing stimuli that were neutral in terms of valence and body shape was identified. Interestingly, at a descriptive level, the thinness/fatness manipulations of the bodies were in a curvilinear relationship with the valence ratings: Thin bodies were not only judged as positive, but also as negative when their estimated body mass indexes (BMIs) decreased too much. Finally, convergent validity was assessed by exploring the impacts of body-image-related variables (BMI, thin-ideal internalization, and body dissatisfaction) on participants' judgments of the bodies. Valence judgments, but not body shape judgments, were influenced by the participants' levels of thin-ideal internalization and body dissatisfaction. Participants' BMIs did not significantly influence their judgments. Given these findings, this database contains relevant material that can be used in various fields, primarily for studies of body-image disturbance or eating disorders.

Much of the evidence for modality-specificity in conceptual processing comes from the property-verification task. When applying this and other tasks, it is important to select items based on their modality-exclusivity. We collected modality ratings for a set of 387 properties, each of which was paired with two different concepts, yielding a total of 774 concept-property items. For each item, participants rated the degree to which the property could be experienced through five perceptual modalities (vision, audition, touch, smell, and taste). Based on these ratings, we computed a measure of modality exclusivity, the degree to which a property is perceived exclusively through one sensory modality. In this paper, we briefly sketch the theoretical background of conceptual knowledge, discuss the use of the property-verification task in cognitive research, provide our norms and statistics, and validate the norms in a memory experiment. We conclude that our norms are important for researchers studying modality-specific effects in conceptual processing."

Each wordnet in the database represents a language-specific structure due to the unique lexicalization of concepts in languages. The concepts are inter-linked via a separate Inter-Lingual-Index, where equivalent concepts across languages should share the same index item. The flexible multilingual design of the database makes it possible to compare the lexicalizations and semantic structures, revealing answers to fundamental linguistic and philosophical questions which could never be answered before. How consistent are lexical semantic networks across languages, what are the language-specific differences of these networks, is there a language-universal ontology, how much information can be shared across languages? First attempts to answer these questions are given in the form of a set of shared or common Base Concepts that has been derived from the separate wordnets and their classification by a language-neutral top-ontology. These Base Concepts play a fundamental role in several wordnets. Nevertheless, the database may also serve many practical needs with respect to (cross-language) information retrieval, machine translation tools, language generation tools and language learning tools, which are discussed in the final chapter. The book offers an excellent introduction to the EuroWordNet project for scholars in the field and raises many issues that set the directions for further research in semantics and knowledge engineering."

Heinz,NA,ud phonology lab stress pattern database,NA,"Languages with binary stress systems frequently tolerate a stress lapse over the final two syllables, but almost none tolerate a word-initial stress lapse. Lunden (to appear) argues that this lapse asymmetry can be explained by the presence of word-level final lengthening, which can then create the perception of prominence alternation in languages that use duration as stress correlate. The results of a production and a perception study with English speakers are presented which compare /ɑ/s that occur under stress lapse to /ɑ/s in non-stress-lapse positions. While word-final unstressed /ɑ/ is always longer than non-final unstressed /ɑ/, it is significantly longer when immediately following an unstressed syllable. Similarly, unstressed word-final /ɑ/ has a higher F1 and lower F2 than non-final unstressed /ɑ/, but word-finally this less-reduced vowel is closer to a full vowel when the final syllable is part of a stress lapse. The perception study finds that these differences have perceptual consequences that can lead to a perceived continued rhythm in stress lapse. The phonetic differences explain why a word-final unstressed vowel can be perceived as relatively strong when following an unstressed syllable but as relatively weak when following a stressed syllable."

TLS is a sustained effort in philological and philosophical fieldwork, designed throughout to make the classical Chinese evidence strictly comparable to that of other cultures, and to make possible meaningful analytic primary-evidence-based disagreement among non-sinologists on classical Chinese concepts and words. TLS is compiled in the hope that careful philosophical reflection on Chinese texts might serve to broaden the empirical basis for philosophical theories and generalisations on conceptual schemes. TLS is based on the conviction that we should improve the clarity and bite of declarations of difference between conceptual schemes by enlarging the basis of literally translated and analysed texts from widely (though never radically) different intellectual cultures. The necessary charitable assumption that if we want to understand others we must count them right in most matters will not prevent TLS from looking for and exploring deep conceptual contrasts to the full. TLS seeks to make precise criteria of translation for classical Chinese, mainly through a detailed description in English of systematic recurrent semantic relations between Chinese words, especially distinctive semantic features. TLS is the first synonym dictionary of classical Chinese in any Western language. TLS focusses on distinctive semantic nuances. TLS is the first interactive dictionary of Chinese. TLS is the first dictionary which systematically organises the Chinese vocabulary in taxonomic and mereonomic hierarchies thus showing up whole conceptual schemes or cognitive systems. These are taken to circumscribe the changing topology of Chinese mental space. TLS is the first dictionary that systematically registers a range of lexical relations like antonym, converse, epithet etc. TLS thus aims to define conceptual space as a relational space. TLS is the first dictionary of Chinese which incorporates detailed syntactic analysis of (over 600 distinct kinds of) syntactic usage. TLS thus enables us to make a systematic study of such basic phenomena as the natural history of abstract nouns in China. TLS is the first corpus-based dictionary which will record the history of rhetorical devices in texts and will thus enable us to study such intellectually crucial things as the natural history of irony in China.

A query of words to count the frequency of produces both a line chart and a table with more detailed information. The child language data is taken from the English part of the CHILDES database 1 and comprises more than 5,000 transcriptions ,a total of ≈ 3, 500, 000 word tokens. The children's ages range from six months to seven years, with most children being three years old. ChildFreq is freely available online at http://childfreq.sumsar.net ."
"c(""Bickel, Balthasar"", ""Nichols, Johanna"")",NA,autotypologizing databases and their use in fieldwork,2002,"This paper presents two database methods for crosslinguistic data collection and comparison: autotypologizing and exemplar-based sampling. Autotypologizing dispenses with a priori defined comparative grids and instead lets structural types emerge inductively through a type list that is constantly updated in response to languages entered in a database. Examplar-based sampling allows identification of a single representative of cross-linguistically heterogeneous structural domains such as case. These two methods are helpful tools in fieldwork. Autotypologizing generates inventories of known types. These inventories update researchers' expectance range for newly encountered types (like published typological surveys, but more dynamically). Examplar-based sampling is useful for writing typological profiles at very early stages of description."

Although – given the nature of the data – it seems natural to model and analyze it with the help of network techniques, there are only a few approaches which make explicit use of them. In this paper, we show how the strict application of weighted network models helps to get more out of cross-linguistic polysemies than would be possible using approaches that are only based on item-to-item comparison. For our study we use a large dataset consisting of 1252 semantic items translated into 195 different languages covering 44 different language families. By analyz-ing the community structure of the network reconstructed from the data, we find that a majority of the concepts (68{\%}) can be separated into 104 large communities consisting of five and more nodes. These large communities almost exclusively constitute meaningful groupings of concepts into con-ceptual fields. They provide a valid starting point for deeper analyses of various topics in historical semantics, such as cognate detection, etymological analysis, and semantic reconstruction."

The corpus contains a total of over 36 h of recordings of 46 French speakers engaged in conversations with friends. Casual speech was elicited during three different parts, which together provided around 90 min of speech from every pair of speakers. While Parts 1 and 2 did not require participants to perform any specific task, in Part 3 participants negotiated a common answer to general questions about society. Comparisons with the ESTER corpus of journalistic speech show that the two corpora contain speech of considerably different registers. A number of indicators of casualness, including swear words, casual words, verlan, disfluencies and word repetitions, are more frequent in the NCCFr than in the ESTER corpus, while the use of double negation, an indicator of formal speech, is less frequent. In general, these estimates of casualness are constant through the three parts of the recording sessions and across speakers. Based on these facts, we conclude that our corpus is a rich resource of highly casual speech, and that it can be effectively exploited by researchers in language science and technology. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Such a catalogue is useful in several theoretical and methodological respects. First of all, both universal and language-specific semantic shifts can be considered a window onto human cognitive mechanisms operative in the domain of linguistic conceptualization. Second, the catalogue provides a rich empirical basis for the study of genetic and areal tendencies in semantic change, as well as in polysemy patterns. Another potential application is historical reconstruction, since the catalogue gives evidence for attested paths of diachronic semantic evolution. In section 1 we outline the general concept of the Catalogue of Semantic Shifts. Section 2 describes the design of the computer database. In section 3 we discuss some problematic points that we have faced while working on the Catalogue. The next three sections demonstrate how the Catalogue can be used in linguistic research and present an analysis of three selected issues, namely semantic shifts in the domain of dimension (section 4), motivation strategies in the domain of folk biology (section 5), and euphemization as a mechanism of semantic change (section 6)."
"Winter, Bodo","Language, Cognition and Neuroscience",taste and smell words form an affectively loaded and emotionally flexible part of the english lexicon,2016,"ABSTRACTIn brain and behaviour, gustation, and olfaction are closely linked to emotional processing. This paper shows that similarly, words associated with taste and smell, such as “pungent” and “delicious”, are on average more emotionally valenced than words associated with the other senses, such as “beige” (visual) and “echoing” (auditory). Moreover, taste and smell words occur more frequently in emotionally valenced phrases, for example, “fragrant” modifies more emotionally valenced nouns (“fragrant kiss”) than the visual adjective “yellow” (“yellow house”). It is argued that taste and smell words form an affectively loaded part of the English lexicon. Taste and smell words are also shown to be more emotionally flexible in that words such as “sweet” can be combined with both good and bad nouns (“sweet delight” versus “sweet disaster”), much more so than is the case for sensory words for the other modalities. The paper discusses implications for theories of embodied language understanding."

Early‐learned words are higher in iconicity than later learned words. However, it remains unclear what role iconicity may play in actual language use. Here, we ask whether iconicity relates not just to the age at which words are acquired, but also to how frequently children and adults use the words in their speech. If iconicity serves to bootstrap word learning, then we would expect that children should say highly iconic words more frequently than less iconic words, especially early in development. We would also expect adults to use iconic words more often when speaking to children than to other adults. We examined the relationship between frequency and iconicity for approximately 2000 English words. Replicating previous findings, we found that more iconic words are learned earlier. Moreover, we found that more iconic words tend to be used more by younger children, and adults use more iconic words when speaking to children than to other adults. Together, our results show that young children not only learn words rated high in iconicity earlier than words low in iconicity, but they also produce these words more frequently in conversation – a pattern that is reciprocated by adults when speaking with children. Thus, the earliest conversations of children are relatively higher in iconicity, suggesting that this iconicity scaffolds the production and comprehension of spoken language during early development."

Testing these hypotheses has been difficult because the computation of the bigram statistics is difficult. We present a program that calculates bigram measures for two-to nine-letter words. We then show how the program can be used to compare the contribution of top rank and other bigram frequency measures derived from both a token and a type count. Contrary to previous research, we report that type measures are not better at predicting anagram solution times and that top rank is not the best predictor of anagram difficulty.

Specifically, the EL 2.0 utilizes natural language to measure the emotionality, extremity, and valence of evaluative reactions and attitudes. The present article describes how we used a combination of 9 million real-world online reviews and over 1,500 participant judges to construct the EL 2.0 and an additional 5.7 million reviews to validate it. To assess its unique value, the EL 2.0 is compared with two other prominent text analysis tools—LIWC and Warriner et al.'s (Behavior Research Methods, 45, 1191–1207, 2013) wordlist. The EL 2.0 is comparatively distinct in its ability to measure emotionality and explains a significantly greater proportion of the variance in individuals' evaluations. The EL 2.0 can be used with any data that involve speech or writing and provides researchers with the opportunity to capture evaluative reactions both in the laboratory and “in the wild.” The EL 2.0 wordlist and normative emotionality, extremity, and valence ratings are freely available from www.evaluativelexicon.com."

Adults need to be able to process infants' emotional expressions accurately to respond appropriately and care for infants. However, research on processing of the emotional expressions of infant faces is hampered by the lack of validated stimuli. Although many sets of photographs of adult faces are available to researchers, there are no corresponding sets of photographs of infant faces. We therefore developed and validated a database of infant faces, which is available via e-mail request. Parents were recruited via social media and asked to send photographs of their infant (0–12 months of age) showing positive, negative, and neutral facial expressions. A total of 195 infant faces were obtained and validated. To validate the images, student midwives and nurses (n = 53) and members of the general public (n = 18) rated each image with respect to its facial expression, intensity of expression, clarity of expression, genuineness of expression, and valence. On the basis of these ratings, a total of 154 images with rating agreements of at least 75{\%} were included in the final database. These comprise 60 photographs of positive infant faces, 54 photographs of negative infant faces, and 40 photographs of neutral infant faces. The images have high criterion validity and good test–retest reliability. This database is therefore a useful and valid tool for researchers."

To understand the impact of phonotactic regularities on speech and language functions at the behavioral and neural levels, it is essential to have access to oral language corpora to study these complex phenomena in different languages. Yet, probably because of their complexity, oral language corpora remain less common than written language corpora. This article presents the first corpus and database of spoken Quebec French syllables and phones: SyllabO+. This corpus contains phonetic transcriptions of over 300,000 syllables (over 690,000 phones) extracted from recordings of 184 healthy adult native Quebec French speakers, ranging in age from 20 to 97 years. To ensure the representativeness of the corpus, these recordings were made in both formal and familiar communication contexts. Phonotactic distributional statistics (e.g., syllable and co-occurrence frequencies, percentages, percentile ranks, transition probabilities, and pointwise mutual information) were computed from the corpus. An open-access online application to search the database was developed, and is available at www.speechneurolab.ca/syllabo . In this article, we present a brief overview of the corpus, as well as the syllable and phone databases, and we discuss their practical applications in various fields of research, including cognitive neuroscience, psycholinguistics, neurolinguistics, experimental psychology, phonetics, and phonology.

To keep pace with these developments, in the present study we generated a large set of metaphoric and literal sentence pairs ideally suited to addressing the current methodological and conceptual needs of metaphor researchers. In particular, the need has emerged to distinguish metaphors along three dimensions: the grammatical class of their base terms, the sensorimotor features of their base terms, and the syntactic form in which the base terms appear. To meet this need, we generated nominal metaphors (and matched literal sentences) using entity nouns as the base terms, with the intention that they be used in concert with already published sets of predicate metaphors or nominal metaphors using event nouns. Using the results of three norming experiments, we provide 120 pairs of closely matched metaphoric and literal sentences that are characterized along 14 dimensions: 11 at the sentence level (length, frequency, concreteness, familiarity, naturalness, imageability, figurativeness, interpretability, ease of interpretation, valence, and valence judgment reaction time), and three related to the base term (visual, motion, and auditory imagery).

Although many text-to-speech systems are available, researchers of human nonverbal vocalizations and bioacousticians may profit from a dedicated simple tool for synthesizing and manipulating natural-sounding vocalizations. Soundgen (https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=soundgen) is an open-source R package that synthesizes nonverbal vocalizations based on meaningful acoustic parameters, which can be specified from the command line or in an interactive app. This tool was validated by comparing the perceived emotion, valence, arousal, and authenticity of 60 recorded human nonverbal vocalizations (screams, moans, laughs, and so on) and their approximate synthetic reproductions. Each synthetic sound was created by manually specifying only a small number of high-level control parameters, such as syllable length and a few anchors for the intonation contour. Nevertheless, the valence and arousal ratings of synthetic sounds were similar to those of the original recordings, and the authenticity ratings were comparable, maintaining parity with the originals for less complex vocalizations. Manipulating the precise acoustic characteristics of synthetic sounds may shed light on the salient predictors of emotion in the human voice. More generally, soundgen may prove useful for any studies that require precise control over the acoustic features of nonspeech sounds, including research on animal vocalizations and auditory perception."

"c(""Chang, Ya-Ning"", ""Lee, Chia-Ying"")",Behavior Research Methods,semantic ambiguity effects on traditional chinese character naming a corpus based approach,2017,"Words are considered semantically ambiguous if they have more than one meaning and can be used in multiple contexts. A number of recent studies have provided objective ambiguity measures by using a corpus-based approach and have demonstrated ambiguity advantages in both naming and lexical decision tasks. Although the predictive power of objective ambiguity measures has been examined in several alphabetic language systems, the effects in logographic languages remain unclear. Moreover, most ambiguity measures do not explicitly address how the various contexts associated with a given word relate to each other. To explore these issues, we computed the contextual diversity (Adelman, Brown, {\&} Quesada, Psychological Science, 17; 814-823, 2006) and semantic ambiguity (Hoffman, Lambon Ralph, {\&} Rogers, Behavior Research Methods, 45; 718-730, 2013) of traditional Chinese single-character words based on the Academia Sinica Balanced Corpus, where contextual diversity was used to evaluate the present semantic space. We then derived a novel ambiguity measure, namely semantic variability, by computing the distance properties of the distinct clusters grouped by the contexts that contained a given word. We demonstrated that semantic variability was superior to semantic diversity in accounting for the variance in naming response times, suggesting that considering the substructure of the various contexts associated with a given word can provide a relatively fine scale of ambiguity information for a word. All of the context and ambiguity measures for 2,418 Chinese single-character words are provided as supplementary materials."

These expressions were identified by a group of native Mandarin listeners in a seven-alternative forced choice task, and items reaching a recognition rate of at least three times chance performance in the seven-choice task were selected as a valid database and then subjected to acoustic analysis. The results demonstrated expected variations in both perceptual and acoustic patterns of the seven vocal emotions in Mandarin. For instance, fear, anger, sadness, and neutrality were associated with relatively high recognition, whereas happiness, disgust, and pleasant surprise were recognized less accurately. Acoustically, anger and pleasant surprise exhibited relatively high mean f0 values and large variation in f0 and amplitude; in contrast, sadness, disgust, fear, and neutrality exhibited relatively low mean f0 values and small amplitude variations, and happiness exhibited a moderate mean f0 value and f0 variation. Emotional expressions varied systematically in speech rate and harmonics-to-noise ratio values as well.

To study this issue, a number of stimulus characteristics are of interest that are not yet available in public databases of German. This article provides semantic association ratings, lexical paraphrases, and vector-based similarity measures for German verbs, measuring (a) the semantic transparency between 1,259 complex verbs and their bases, (b) the semantic relatedness between 1,109 verb pairs with 432 different bases, and (c) the vector-based similarity measures of 846 verb pairs.

Recent methodological advances have led to neuroimaging studies presenting striking similarities between neural patterns associated with the processing of music and language--notably, in the study of participants' responses to elements that are incongruous with their musical or linguistic context. Responding to a call for greater systematicity by leading researchers in the field of music and language psychology, this article describes the creation, selection, and validation of a set of auditory stimuli in which both congruence and resolution were manipulated in equivalent ways across harmony, rhythm, semantics, and syntax. Three conditions were created by changing the contexts preceding and following musical and linguistic incongruities originally used for effect by authors and composers: Stimuli in the incongruous-resolved condition reproduced the original incongruity and resolution into the same context; stimuli in the incongruous-unresolved condition reproduced the incongruity but continued postincongruity with a new context dictated by the incongruity; and stimuli in the congruous condition presented the same element of interest, but the entire context was adapted to match it so that it was no longer incongruous. The manipulations described in this article rendered unrecognizable the original incongruities from which the stimuli were adapted, while maintaining ecological validity. The norming procedure and validation study resulted in a significant increase in perceived oddity from congruous to incongruous-resolved and from incongruous-resolved to incongruous-unresolved in all four components of music and language, making this set of stimuli a theoretically grounded and empirically validated resource for this growing area of research."

The BFRT-c requires participants to match a target face photograph to either one or three of six face photographs presented simultaneously. We found that the percent accuracy on the BFRT-c (81{\%}-83{\%}) was below ceiling yet well above chance level, with little interindividual variance in this typical population sample, two important aspects of a sensitive clinical test. Although the split-half reliability on response accuracy was relatively low, due to the large variability in difficulty across items, the correct response times measured in this version-completed in 3 min, on average-provide a reliable and critical complementary measure of performance at individual unfamiliar-face matching. In line with previous observations from other measures, females outperformed male participants at the BFRT-c, especially for female faces. In general, performance was also lower following lighting changes than following head rotations, in line with previous studies that have emphasized participants' limited ability to match pictures of unfamiliar faces with important variations in illumination. Overall, this normative data set supports the validity of the BFRT-c as a key component of a battery of tests to identify clinical impairments in individual face recognition, such as observed in acquired prosopagnosia. However, this analysis strongly recommends that researchers consider the full test results: Beyond global indexes of performance based on accuracy rates only, they should consider the time taken to match individual faces as well as the variability in performance across items."

The stimuli include 20 items ranging in length from one to four syllables. The items consist of dialect-neutral phonemes in consonant-vowel (CV) and CVC sequences that follow the phonotactic constraints of the language. They were rated high on wordlikeness and have comparable position segments and biphone probabilities across stimulus lengths. We validated the stimuli with a sample of 59 typically developing Vietnamese-English bilingual children, ages 5 to 8. The stimuli exhibited the expected age and length effects commonly found in NWR tasks: Older children performed better on the task than younger children, and longer items were more difficult to repeat than shorter items. We also compared different scoring systems in order to examine the individual phoneme types (consonants, vowels, and tones) and composite scores (proportions of phonemes correct, with and without tone). The study demonstrates careful construction and validation of the stimuli, and future directions are discussed."

As a consequence, there are enormous methodological differences in the way the values for morphological variables are calculated across studies. We present a sizeable and freely available database with six new variables for affixes and three for roots for 68,624 words from the English Lexicon Project. We further studied by means of regression models the influence of these new variables on the lexical decision latencies of 4,724 morphologically complex nouns that included one root and one suffix. Results showed that root frequency and suffix length had a facilitatory effect, whereas the percentage of more frequent words in the morphological family of the suffix had an inhibitory effect on latencies. After controlling for collinearity, root family size, suffix family size, suffix P*, and suffix frequency also had facilitatory effects. These results shed new light on the importance of suffix length and the frequency of the lexical competitors of the family of a suffix.

The data set also contains estimates of modality exclusivity—that is, a measure of the extent to which a particular property may be considered unimodal (i.e., perceived through one sense alone). Although there already exists a number of sets of word and object norms, we provide the first set to categorize words describing object properties along the dimensions of the five perceptual modalities.

The Minho Affective Sentences (MAS) were developed to respond to the lack of a standardized sentence battery with normative affective ratings: 192 neutral, positive, and negative declarative sentences were strictly controlled for psycholinguistic variables such as numbers of words and letters and per-million word frequency. The sentences were designed to represent examples of each of the five basic emotions (anger, sadness, disgust, fear, and happiness) and of neutral situations. These sentences were presented to 536 participants who rated the stimuli using both dimensional and categorical measures of emotions. Sex differences were also explored. Additionally, we probed how personality, empathy, and mood from a subset of 40 participants modulated the affective ratings. Our results confirmed that the MAS affective norms are valid measures to guide the selection of stimuli for experimental studies of emotion. The combination of dimensional and categorical ratings provided a more fine-grained characterization of the affective properties of the sentences. Moreover, the affective ratings of positive and negative sentences were not only modulated by participants' sex, but also by individual differences in empathy and mood state. Together, our results indicate that, in their quest to reveal the neurofunctional underpinnings of verbal emotional processing, researchers should consider not only the role of sex, but also of interindividual differences in empathy and mood states, in responses to the emotional meaning of sentences."

Norms were collected from healthy speakers, using a picture-naming paradigm and rating tasks. Norms for naming latencies, name agreement, visual complexity, image agreement, imageability, age of acquisition, and familiarity were established. Furthermore, the database includes other intrinsic factors, such as syllable length and phoneme length. It also includes orthographic frequency values (extracted from Aralex; Boudelaa {\&} Marslen-Wilson, 2010). These factors were then examined for their impact on picture-naming latencies in object- and action-naming tasks. The analysis showed that the primary determinants of naming latencies in both nouns and verbs are (in descending order) image agreement, name agreement, familiarity, age of acquisition, and imageability. These results indicate no evidence that noun- and verb-naming processes in Gulf Arabic are influenced in different ways by these variables. This is the first database for Gulf Arabic, and therefore the norms collected from the present study will be of paramount importance for researchers and clinicians working with speakers of this variety of Arabic.

We introduce the Change Blindness (CB) Database with object changes in 130 colored images of natural indoor scenes. The size and eccentricity are provided for all the changes as well as reaction time data from a baseline experiment. In addition, we have two specialized satellite databases that are subsets of the 130 images. In one set, changes are seen in rooms or in mirrors in those rooms (Mirror Change Database). In the other, changes occur in a room or out a window (Window Change Database). Both the sets have controlled background, change size, and eccentricity. The CB Database is intended to provide researchers with a stimulus set of natural scenes with defined stimulus parameters that can be used for a wide range of experiments.

In language production research, the latency with which speakers produce a spoken response to a stimulus and the onset and offset times of words in longer utterances are key dependent variables. Measuring these variables automatically often yields partially incorrect results. However, exact measurements through the visual inspection of the recordings are extremely time-consuming. We present AlignTool, an open-source alignment tool that establishes preliminarily the onset and offset times of words and phonemes in spoken utterances using Praat, and subsequently performs a forced alignment of the spoken utterances and their orthographic transcriptions in the automatic speech recognition system MAUS. AlignTool creates a Praat TextGrid file for inspection and manual correction by the user, if necessary. We evaluated AlignTool's performance with recordings of single-word and four-word utterances as well as semi-spontaneous speech. AlignTool performs well with audio signals with an excellent signal-to-noise ratio, requiring virtually no corrections. For audio signals of lesser quality, AlignTool still is highly functional but its results may require more frequent manual corrections. We also found that audio recordings including long silent intervals tended to pose greater difficulties for AlignTool than recordings filled with speech, which AlignTool analyzed well overall. We expect that by semi-automatizing the temporal analysis of complex utterances, AlignTool will open new avenues in language production research."

In this task, participants study letter strings constructed according to the rules of an artificial grammar and subsequently attempt to discriminate grammatical from ungrammatical test strings. Although the data from these experiments are usually analyzed by comparing the mean discrimination performance between experimental conditions, this practice discards information about the individual items and participants that could otherwise help uncover the particular features of strings associated with grammaticality judgments. However, feature analysis is tedious to compute, often complicated, and ill-defined in the literature. Moreover, the data violate the assumption of independence underlying standard linear regression models, leading to Type I error inflation. To solve these problems, we present AGSuite, a free Shiny application for researchers studying AGL. The suite's intuitive Web-based user interface allows researchers to generate strings from a database of published grammars, compute feature measures (e.g., Levenshtein distance) for each letter string, and conduct a feature analysis on the strings using linear mixed effects (LME) analyses. The LME analysis solves the inflation of Type I errors that afflicts more common methods of repeated measures regression analysis. Finally, the software can generate a number of graphical representations of the data to support an accurate interpretation of results. We hope the ease and availability of these tools will encourage researchers to take full advantage of item-level variance in their datasets in the study of AGL. We moreover discuss the broader applicability of the tools for researchers looking to conduct feature analysis in any field."

However, considering the limitations of the existing auditory stimulus database studies, research using auditory stimuli is relatively limited compared with the studies using visual stimuli. First, the number of sample sounds is limited, making it difficult to equate across emotional conditions and semantic categories. Second, some artificially created materials (music or human voice) may fail to accurately drive the intended emotional processes. Our principal aim was to expand existing auditory affective sample database to sufficiently cover natural sounds. We asked 207 participants to rate 935 sounds (including the sounds from the IADS-2) using the Self-Assessment Manikin (SAM) and three basic-emotion rating scales. The results showed that emotions in sounds can be distinguished on the affective rating scales, and the stability of the evaluations of sounds revealed that we have successfully provided a larger corpus of natural, emotionally evocative auditory stimuli, covering a wide range of semantic categories.

These lists, however, present limitations when studying the relation between emotion and cognitive processes such as time and number processing because affective words do not inherently contain time or quantity information. Live events, in contrast, are experienced by an observer and therefore inherently carry affect information. Unfortunately, existing life-event lists and inventories have been largely applied within clinical contexts as diagnostic tools, and therefore are not suitable for many experimental contexts because they do not contain a balanced number of reliably positive, negative, and neutral life events. In Experiment 1, we create a standardized affect-related life-events list with 171 positive, negative, and neutral affect-related life events. In Experiment 2, we show that strength of affect and significance of the event are integral dimensions, suggesting that these two features are difficult to separate perceptually.

We present a resource including optimized estimates of OSC for 15,017 English words. In a series of analyses, we provide a progressive optimization of the OSC variable. We show that computing OSC from word-embeddings models (in place of traditional count models), limiting preprocessing of the corpus used for inducing semantic vectors (in particular, avoiding part-of-speech tagging and lemmatization), and relying on a wider pool of orthographic relatives provide better performance for the measure in a lexical-processing task. We further show that OSC is an important and significant predictor of reaction times in visual word recognition and word naming, one that correlates only weakly with other psycholinguistic variables (e.g., family size, word frequency), indicating that it captures a novel source of variance in lexical access. Finally, some theoretical and methodological implications are discussed of adopting OSC as one of the predictors of reaction times in studies of visual word recognition."

Prior to its privatisation in 1984, BT was a public corporation (and before that a government department) and as a result all of the pre-privatisation material in the archives is in the public domain, making it ideal for academic research. Despite this legal availability, however, the physical availability of material in the archive was limited to two days a week in an archive space in Holborn, London. In 2011 the ‘New Connections' project was set up with the aim of making around half a million items from the public archives of British Telecom available in a new digital archive. As part of ‘New Connections', three academic research projects were funded, one of which was the creation and analysis of the British Telecom Correspondence Corpus (BTCC). The era that the archive covers makes it a potentially fascinating source of data for the linguistic study of business correspondence. The mid-nineteenth to latetwentieth century is a crucial period in the development of English business correspondence as the amount of business being conducted by letter increased massively during this period as a result of the Industrial Revolution, the introduction of the Penny Post, and increased access to education both in schools and through composition grammar guides. Despite its importance in the development of business correspondence, this period has received relatively little attention. The aim of constructing the British Telecom Correspondence Corpus was to start addressing this gap in available linguistic data and enable studies into the development of business correspondence from the mid-nineteenth to late-twentieth century."

This paper describes the typological standpoint of the LAS2, its position with respect to other corpora of learner Finnish, the compilation criteria, the annotation applied and the workflow implemented. The corpus consists of three subcorpora of written academic texts of non-native speakers of Finnish. The subcorpora are 1) texts for examination purposes, 2) texts for publishing and graduating purposes, and 3) texts for studying and learning purposes. The informants either study or work in Finnish within academia in Finland. When available, the data has been collected longitudinally. A reference corpus for each subcorpus written by native speakers has also been compiled. Three query tools designed within the framework of the LAS2 are also introduced. These tools enable queries based on any combinations of the linguistic annotation. They can also be used to analyse the typical inner or cotextual variation of any user-specified linguistic node or to create frequency lists of multiword units defined at any level of the annotation.

The purpose of this study was twofold. First, it was designed to provide memory and psycholinguistic researchers with extensive synonym norms. Second, it was designed to evaluate the effects of encoding order on perceived synonymy. The hypothesis that limited semantic-memory access can cause synonym pairs to be rated as more synonymous in one word-order than in the other was tested by presenting each noun pair to 50 judges in one order and to another 50 judges in the reverse order. Mean synonym ratings (averaged across word orders) ranged from 6.79 to 2.24, thus demonstrating the need for normative data on synonyms. A significant number of noun pairs showed strong directional effects such that perceived synonymy was significantly changed by word encoding order. The practical and theoretical importance of these directional effects are discussed. {\textcopyright} 1979 Academic Press, Inc."

This spoken count was undertaken to investigate those aspects of word usage and frequency which could cast light on lexical processes in grammar and verbal development in children. Three groups of 30 children each (boys and girls) from middle-class background were used. No child had any apparent speech or hearing handicap; all were from relatively urban areas and came from English-speaking homes. Each child was shown a 20-card form of the Thematic Apperception Test and was asked to tell stories for the pictures displayed on the cards. Each story-telling session lasted one hour and was tape-recorded. For each age group there are three word lists: (1) words ordered by frequency of use, (2) words categorized by part-of-speech classes, and (3) words alphabetically ordered. The codification procedure and the rationale for each frequency list are explained in detail."

These experiments deal with the effects of the frequency of letters and letter-combinations on serial and paired-associate learning, the effect of ""pronunciability"" on learning, the effect of frequency on letter-sequence habits, and the difference in the effect of the meaningfulness of a word depending on whether the word is a stimulus or a response."

"c(""Burgess, Curt"", ""Lund, Kevin"")",Language and Cognitive Processes,modelling parsing constraints with high dimensional context space,1997,"Deriving representations of meaning has been a long-standing problem in cognitive psychology and psycholinguistics. The lack of a model for representing semantic and grammatical knowledge has been a handicap in attempting to model the effects of semantic constraints in human syntactic processing. A computational model of high-dimensional context space, the Hyperspace Analogue to Language (HAL), is presented with a series of simulations modelling a variety of human empirical results. HAL learns its representations from the unsupervised processing of 300 million words of conversational text. HAL's high-dimensional context space can be used to (1) provide a basic categorization of semantic and grammatical concepts, (2) model certain aspects of morphological ambiguity in verbs, and (3) provide an account of semantic context effects in syntactic processing. The authors propose that the distributed and contextually derived representations that HAL acquires provide a basis for the subconceptual knowledge that can be used in accounting for a diverse set of cognitive phenomena.

Similar to sensitivity factor based method, the proposed methods form a priority list that reduces the solution space. The proposed methodologies are based on the use of LMP differences and congestion rent, respectively. The methods are computationally efficient, since LMPs are the by-product of a security constrained OPF and congestion rent is a function of LMP difference and power flows. The proposed methodologies are tested and validated for locating TCSC in IEEE 14-, IEEE 30- and IEEE 57-bus test systems. Results obtained with the proposed methods are compared with that of the sensitivity method and with exhaustive OPF solutions. The overall objective of FACTS device placement can be either to minimize the total congestion rent or to maximize the social welfare. Results show that the proposed methods are capable of finding the best location for TCSC installation, that suite both objectives. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

"HULL, A. J.",British Journal of Psychology,a letterdigit matrix of auditory confusions,1973,"A matrix is presented of the errors of perception made by 135 men and women listening to three male and three female speakers reading aloud different randomized lists constructed from the letters of the alphabet and the digits 1—9, heard in white noise. Data from a short-term memory (STM) experiment, using simultaneous visual presentation and immediate ordered recall of two selected vocabularies of nine letters and the digits 1-9, are cited as evidence of phonemic confusion between letters and digits in STM. Conrad (1964) established a high correlation between the systematic errors made by Hsteners identifying letters of the alphabet spoken one at a time in white noise (auditory confusions), and those made by subjects when visually presented with strings of alphabetic material for immediate ordered recall. Briefly, items which sounded similar were more probably confused not only in listening, but also in short-term memory (STM). Once this relationship between auditory and STM errors had been demonstrated, it was possible, using Clarke's constant ratio rule (Clarke, 1957), to select from the listening matrix subsets of letters of diifering probabilities of auditory confusion. Conrad {\&} Hull (1964) have shown that such subsets selected for minimal auditory confusability, whether of three or nine items in the vocabulary, are significantly better recalled, after visual sequential presentation, than subsets of letters of high auditory confusability. In STM tasks using both letters and digits, Wickelgren (1965) with auditory pre-sentation, and Hintzman (1965) using visual stimuli, have shown that inter-class errors are also related to phonemic similarity. Definition of the extent and relative confusability of letters with digits has been hampered by the lack of a complete matrix of auditory confusions amongst these stimuli. The provision of such a matrix was the purpose of this study. METHOD AND PEOCEDTTKB"

"Ervin-Tripp, Susan M.",Norms of Word Association,substitution context and association,1970,"This chapter discusses the concepts of substitution, context, and association. The elicited sentences cannot give a particularly biased estimate of word contexts for the stimulus words; however, the substitution task elicits far more antonyms than can be expected on the basis of actual contextual similarities of antonyms. The collocational study involves no editing and gives statistics on text frequencies regardless of the grammatical class of the forms. In connected discourse, nouns, verbs, indefinite pronouns, determiners, prepositions, auxiliaries, nominative pronouns, and copulas are most frequent, with adjectives and adverbs relatively infrequent. For all stimulus words, except verbs and gerunds, there is a significant positive relation between association and substitution, that is, the use of semantically and grammatically paradigmatic words as associates. Where there is high commonality in substitutions, responses tend to be paradigmatic. Where there is a high primary in the precontext or high commonality in the five most common postcontexts, the responses tend to be syntagmatic."

The difference between speakers of English and of Western European languages in the diversification of their responses is brought out by the use of the rank-frequency function. The chapter presents a comparison of few of the main characteristics of the sets of Kent–Rosanoff norms among countries and across languages. A simple and frequently used measure of similarity of responses among normative studies is to count the number of items for which the primary responses are identical. This method can be used to compare norms in different languages, to the extent that confidence can be placed in the translation. The chapter also presents a classification of the primary responses of French and American students and workers in terms of grammatical classes of stimuli and responses."
"Cramer, Phebe",Norms of Word Association,a study of homographs,1970,"This chapter discusses homographs. As an isolated unit, the identical spelling and pronunciation of the word provides no clue as to which meaning is intended. Although interpretation of the isolated unit can be influenced by the relative frequency with which the word is used to denote one rather than the other, meaning that only the surrounding context makes clear the intended meaning. Such words that have the same form but more than one meaning are called homonyms. If the two meanings of the word are represented by the same spelling, the word is a homograph. If the two meanings of the word are represented by the same pronunciation, the word is a homophone. A word can be both a homograph and a homophone. Some words are homographs but not homophones. Because homonyms are heavily dependent on context for their interpretation, they provide useful material for studying the modification of verbal meaning as a function of experimental variations in context."

There are 10 triads of each of four types that differ with respect to how the words of each triad are related. In the first type, the three words share inherent features that determine their membership in a common natural category, words of a second type are from different categories but share a sensory characteristic, the third type share both membership in a natural category and a sensory feature, and the fourth type are unrelated. The distributions of responses to these triad types are presented for a college sample as a baseline for a population of high linguistic ability.

The nouns had been randomly selected from the Thorndike-Lorge (T-L) source and had been used as the words in a familiarity scale. The model also provides a satisfactory description of the words from the scale which were common to the T-L count and the later Ku{\v{c}}era-Francis (K-F) count and of scaled words in the T-L count which were missing from the K-F count. For common words, there has been a very small shift toward lower frequencies of occurrence in the time between the counts. The shift originated in frequency changes in words from the middle and upper frequency categories of the familiarity scale. The report suggests that differences in types of words are responsible for differences in distributions obtained by Carroll for all words in the K-F count and the distributions presented here. It is suggested, further, that the familiarity scale continues to be useful."

Deese's 1959 study) revealed remarkable levels of false recall and false recognition in a list learning paradigm. In Experiment 1, subjects studied lists of 12 words (e.g., bed, rest, awake); each list was composed of associates of 1 nonpresented word (e.g., sleep). On immediate free recall tests, the nonpresented associates were recalled 40{\%} of the time and were later recognized with high confidence. In Experiment 2, a false recall rate of 55{\%} was obtained with an expanded set of lists, and on a later recognition test, subjects produced false alarms to these items at a rate comparable to the hit rate. The act of recall enhanced later remembering of both studied and nonstudied material. The results reveal a powerful illusion of memory: People remember events that never happened. False memories—either remembering events that never happened, or remembering them quite differently from the way they happened—have recently captured the attention of both psychologists and the public at large. The primary impetus for this recent surge of interest is the increase in the number of cases in which memories of previously unrecognized abuse are reported during the course of therapy. Some researchers have argued that certain therapeutic practices can cause the creation of false memories, and therefore, the apparent ""recovery"" of memories during the course of therapy may actually represent the creation of memories (Lindsay {\&} Read, 1994; Loftus, 1993). Although the concept of false memories is currently enjoying an increase in publicity, it is not new; psychologists have been studying false memories in several laboratory paradigms for years. Schacter (in press) provides an historical overview of the study of memory distortions. Bartlett (1932) is usually credited with conducting the first experimental investigation of false memories; he had subjects read an Indian folktale, ""The War of the Ghosts,"" and recall it repeatedly. Although he reported no aggregate data, but only sample protocols, his results seemed to show distortions in subjects' memories over repeated attempts to recall the story. Interestingly, Bartlett's repeated reproduction results never have been successfully replicated by later researchers (see Gauld {\&} Stephenson, 1967; Roediger, Wheeler, {\&} Rajaram, 1993); indeed, Wheeler and Roediger (1992) showed that recall of prose passages (including ""The War of the Ghosts"") This research was supported by Grant F49620-92-J-0437 from the Air Force Office of Scientific Research.

We present the data of the Dutch Lexicon Project (DLP) in which a group of 39 participants made lexical decisions to 14,000 words and the same number of nonwords. To examine whether the extensive practice precludes comparison with the traditional short experiments, we look at the differences between the first and the last session, compare the results with the English Lexicon Project (ELP) and the French Lexicon Project (FLP), and examine to what extent established findings in Dutch psycholinguistics can be replicated in virtual experiments. Our results show that when good nonwords are used, practice effects are minimal in lexical decision experiments and do not invalidate the behavioral data. For instance, the word frequency curve is the same in DLP as in ELP and FLP. Also, the Dutch-English cognate effect is the same in DLP as in a previously published factorial experiment. This means that large-scale word recognition studies can make use of psychophysical and psychometrical approaches. In addition, our data represent an important collection of very long series of individual reaction times that may be of interest to researchers in other areas."
"Deese, James",Journal of Verbal Learning and Verbal Behavior,the associative structure of some common english adjectives,1964,"This paper presents an analysis of the relations among the associative distributions to 278 English adjectives. These adjectives provide a nearly exhaustive sample of adjectives with Thorndike-Lorge frequencies of 50 occurrences per million or greater. The analysis shows that among these adjectives there are 40 pairs of polar opposites or contrasts. Factor analysis of the intersections of associative distributions among these polar opposites reveals that they are nearly completely orthogonal. There is a sizeable correlation between loadings for the pairs big-little and large-small; nearly all the remaining pairs produce correlations close to zero. Some of the pairs define scales on which it is possible to locate parts of the intraverbal meaning of other adjectives. More than 100 adjectives in the present sample are located on one or more scales produced by the basic contrasts. Not all pairs of contrasts, however, have scalar properties; these words define contrasts but not contrasting scales. Finally, not all adjectives are organized by contrast, though it is probable that a very large number, perhaps the majority, are. Finally evidence is presented for the general linguistic validity of the results of factor analysis of associative meaning. Such evidence points to the determination of intraverbal relations in meaning by partial contextual equivalences plus whatever external contingencies exist between words and the environment at large. {\textcopyright} 1964 Academic Press Inc.

The Minnesota word association norms are usually known as the Minnesota norms for the Kent–Rosanoff word association test. If the frequency of occurrence of responses to the particular stimulus word is tabulated and then arranged in order of descending frequency, it is customary to describe this series as the associative hierarchy or the associative response hierarchy for the particular stimulus word. There is a general negative relationship between the frequency of popular responses to stimuli and the number of different responses made to the stimuli. The norms have found a wide variety of uses in the experimental laboratory and have also provided a measure of individual differences. The norms provide an index of powerful verbal habits that are shared by members of the college student community."

Two areas notably lacking are the paucity of megastudies in Chinese and the relatively infrequent use of the lexical decision paradigm to investigate single-character recognition. The Chinese Lexicon Project, described in this article, is a database of lexical decision latencies for 2,500 Chinese single characters in simplified script, collected from a sample of native mainland Chinese (Mandarin) speakers (N = 35). This resource will provide a valuable adjunct to influential mega-databases, such as the English, French, and Dutch Lexicon Projects. Using two separate analyses, some advantages associated with megastudies are exemplified. These include the selection of the strongest measure to represent Chinese character frequency (Cai {\&} Brysbaert's (PLoS ONE 5(6): e10729, 2010) subtitle contextual diversity frequency count), and the conducting of virtual studies to replicate and clarify existing findings. The unique morpho-syllabic nature of the Chinese writing system makes it a valuable case study for functional language contrasts. Moreover, this is the first publicly available large-scale repository of behavioral responses pertaining to Chinese language processing (the behavioral dataset is attached to this article, as a supplemental file available for download).

"c(""Rossion, Bruno"", ""Pourtois, Gilles"")",Perception,revisiting snodgrass and vanderwarts object pictorial set the role of surface detail in basic level object recognition,2004,"Theories of object recognition differ to the extent that they consider object representations as being mediated only by the shape of the object, or shape and surface details, if surface details are part of the representation. In particular, it has been suggested that color information may be helpful at recognizing objects only in very special cases, but not during basic-level object recognition in good viewing conditions. In this study, we collected normative data (naming agreement, familiarity, complexity, and imagery judgments) for Snodgrass and Vanderwart's object database of 260 black-and-white line drawings, and then compared the data to exactly the same shapes but with added gray-level texture and surface details (set 2), and color (set 3). Naming latencies were also recorded. Whereas the addition of texture and shading without color only slightly improved naming agreement scores for the objects, the addition of color information unambiguously improved naming accuracy and speeded correct response times. As shown in previous studies, the advantage provided by color was larger for objects with a diagnostic color, and structurally similar shapes, such as fruits and vegetables, but was also observed for man-made objects with and without a single diagnostic color. These observations show that basic-level 'everyday' object recognition in normal conditions is facilitated by the presence of color information, and support a 'shape + surface' model of object recognition, for which color is an integral part of the object representation. In addition, the new stimuli (sets 2 and 3) and the corresponding normative data provide valuable materials for a wide range of experimental and clinical studies of object recognition."

This does not necessarily imply that access to a lexical entry ever occurs via a phono- logical recoding of a visually-presented word. The phonological recoding procedure might be so slow that when the letter string presented is a word, access to its lexical entry via a visual representation is always achieved before phonological recoding is completed. If prelexical phonological recodings are produced by using grapheme-phoneme correspondence rules, such recodings can only occur for words which conform to these rules (regular words), since applications of the rules to words which do not conform to the rules (exception words) produce incorrect phonological representations. In two experiments, it was found that time to achieve lexical access (as measured by YES latency in a lexical decision task) was equivalent for regular words and exception words. It was concluded that access to lexical entries in lexical decision experiments of this sort does not proceed by sometimes or always phonologically recoding visually-presented words."

Errors showed a systematic relationship to original stimuli. This is held to meet a requirement of the decay theory of immediate memory. The same letter vocabulary was used in a test in which subjects were required to identify the letters spoken against a white noise background. A highly significant correlation was found between letters which confused in the listening test, and letters which confused in recall. The role of neurological noise in recall is discussed in relation to these results. It is further argued that information theory is inadequate to explain the memory span, since the nature of the stimulus set, which can be defined quantitatively, as well as the information per item, is likely to be a determining factor."

The sentences were articulated by two native Persian speakers (one male, one female) in three conditions: (1) congruent (emotional lexical content articulated in a congruent emotional voice), (2) incongruent (neutral sentences articulated in an emotional voice), and (3) baseline (all emotional and neutral sentences articulated in neutral voice). The speech materials comprise about 470 sentences. The validity of the database was evaluated by a group of 34 native speakers in a perception test. Utterances recognized better than five times chance performance (71.4 {\%}) were regarded as valid portrayals of the target emotions. Acoustic analysis of the valid emotional utterances revealed differences in pitch, intensity, and duration, attributes that may help listeners to correctly classify the intended emotion.

Thus, it would seem that TA readers rely on semantics even when reading individual Arabic words that are transparent in terms of orthography-to-phonology mappings. This database represents a precious and much-needed psycholinguistic resource for researchers investigating language processing in Arabic-speaking populations."

Subjective ratings of acquisition ages have been successfully employed to study the effect of age of acquisition (AoA). Although a large number of norms exist in many languages, fewer are available for German. Therefore, subjective AoA ratings for 3,259 German words were collected online, includ-ing 2,363 nouns and 473 verbs. These words were presented in lists of 140 words, and participants rated the age in years at which they had first learned each word. A split-half correla-tion testified to a high internal reliability. There were also high correlations with rated AoA values for subsets of the items that had been collected in previous studies, in both German and English. Age and gender were found to influence the ratings very weakly, in that older and male participants tended to give slightly higher age ratings. Education, multilingualism, and frequent usage of languages other than German did not exert an influence on the rating values. These new ratings will ex-tend the currently existing norms available for language and reading research across languages and will provide re-searchers with a wider choice of word stimuli. The ratings are available expressed in two measurements: age in years, and AoA rated on a 7-point Likert scale."

Need-of-help recognition is one aspect of socioemotional development and a necessary precondition for active helping. The NeoHelp consists of picture pairs showing everyday situations: The first item in a pair depicts a child needing help to achieve a goal; the second one shows the child achieving the goal. Pictures of birds in analogue situations are also included. These control stimuli enable implementation of a human-animal categorization task which serves to separate behavioral correlates specific to need-of-help recognition from general differentiation processes. It is a concern in experimental research to ensure that results do not relate to systematic perceptual differences when comparing responses to categories of different content. Therefore, we not only derived the NeoHelp-pictures within a pair from one another by altering as little as possible, but also assessed their perceptual similarity empirically. We show that NeoHelp-picture pairs are very similar regarding low-level perceptual properties across content categories. We obtained data from 60 children in a broad age range (4 to 13 years) for three different paradigms, in order to assess whether the intended categorization and differentiation could be observed reliably in a normative population. Our results demonstrate that children can differentiate the pictures' content regarding both need-of-help category as well as species as intended in spite of the high perceptual similarities. We provide standard response characteristics (hit rates and response times) that are useful for future selection of stimuli and comparison of results across studies. We show that task requirements coherently determine which aspects of the pictures influence response characteristics. Thus, we present NeoHelp, the first open-access standardized visual stimuli set for investigation of need-of-help recognition and invite researchers to use and extend it."

This study extends the currently available materials on everyday metaphorical expressions by providing the first dataset of metaphors extracted from literary texts and scored for the major psycholinguistic variables, considering also the effect of context. A set of 115 Italian literary metaphors presented in isolation (Experiment 1) and a subset of 65 literary metaphors embedded in their original texts (Experiment 2) were rated on several dimensions (word and phrase frequency, readability, cloze probability, familiarity, concreteness, difficulty and meaningfulness). Overall, literary metaphors scored around medium-low values on all dimensions in both experiments. Collected data were subjected to correlation analysis, which showed the presence of a strong cluster of variables-mainly familiarity, difficulty, and meaningfulness-when literary metaphor were presented in isolation. A weaker cluster was observed when literary metaphors were presented in the original contexts, with familiarity no longer correlating with meaningfulness. Context manipulation influenced familiarity, concreteness and difficulty ratings, which were lower in context than out of context, while meaningfulness increased. Throughout the different dimensions, the literary context seems to promote a global interpretative activity that enhances the open-endedness of the metaphor as a semantic structure constantly open to all possible interpretations intended by the author and driven by the text. This dataset will be useful for the design of future experimental studies both on literary metaphor and on the role of context in figurative meaning, combining ecological validity and aesthetic aspects of language."

Relative meaning frequency is a critical factor to consider in studies of semantic ambiguity. In this work, we examined how this measure may change across the European and Rioplatense dialects of Spanish, as well as how the overall distributional properties differ between Spanish and English, using a computer-assisted norming approach based on dictionary definitions (Armstrong, Tokowicz, {\&} Plaut, 2012). The results showed that the two dialects differ considerably in terms of the relative meaning frequencies of their constituent homonyms, and that the overall distributions of relative frequencies vary considerably across languages, as well. These results highlight the need for localized norms to design powerful studies of semantic ambiguity and suggest that dialectal differences may be responsible for some discrepant effects related to homonymy. In quantifying the reliability of the norms, we also established that as few as seven ratings are needed to converge on a highly stable set of ratings. This approach is therefore a very practical means of acquiring essential data in studies of semantic ambiguity, relative to past approaches, such as those based on the classification of free associates. The norms also present new possibilities for studying semantic ambiguity effects within and between populations who speak one or more languages.

In this paradigm, words semantically related to a single nonpresented critical word are studied. In a later memory test, critical words are often falsely recalled and recognized. The present normative study was conducted to measure the theme identifiability of 60 associative word lists in Spanish that include six words (e.g., stove, coat, blanket, scarf, chill, and bonnet) that are simultaneously associated with three critical words (e.g., HEAT, COLD, and WINTER; Beato {\&} D{\'{i}}ez, Psicothema, 26, 457-463, 2011). Different levels of backward associative strength were used in the construction of the DRM lists. In addition, we used two types of instructions to obtain theme identifiability. In the without-explanation condition, traditional instructions were used, requesting participants to write the theme list. In the with-explanation condition, the false-memory effect and how the lists were built were explained, and an example of a DRM list and critical words was shown. Participants then had to discover the critical words. The results showed that all lists produced theme identifiability. Moreover, some lists had a higher theme identifiability rate (e.g., 61 {\%} for the critical words LOVE, BOYFRIEND, COUPLE) than others (e.g., 24 {\%} for CITY, PLACE, VILLAGE). After comparing the theme identifiabilities in the different conditions, the results indicated higher theme identifiability when the false-memory effect was explained than without such an explanation. Overall, these new normative data provide a useful tool for those experiments that, for example, aim to analyze the wide differences observed in false memory with DRM lists and the role of theme identifiability."

One of the most popular materials used in studies of learning has been a set of Swahili-English word pairs for which Nelson and Dunlosky (Memory 2; 325-335, 1994) published recall norms two decades ago. These norms involved use of the Swahili words as cues to facilitate recall of the English translation. It is unclear whether cueing in the opposite direction (from English to Swahili) would lead to symmetric recall performance. Bilingual research has suggested that translation in these two different directions involves asymmetric links that may differentially impact recall performance, depending on which language is used as the cue (Kroll {\&} Stewart, Journal of Memory and Language 33; 149-174,1994). Moreover, the norms for these and many other learning stimuli have typically been gathered from college students. In the present study, we report recall accuracy and response time norms for Swahili words when they are cued by their English translations. We also report norms for a companion set of fact stimuli that may be used along with the Swahili-English word pairs to assess learning on a broader scale across different stimulus materials. Data were collected using Amazon's Mechanical Turk to establish a sample that was diverse in both age and ethnicity. These different, but related, stimulus sets will be applicable to studies of learning, metacognition, and memory in diverse samples."

In this article, we describe a novel set of computer-generated, dynamic face stimuli. These grayscale faces are tightly controlled for low- and high-level visual properties. All faces are standardized in terms of size, luminance, location, and the size of facial features. Each face begins with a neutral pose and transitions to an expression over the course of 30 frames. Altogether, 222 stimuli were created, spanning three different categories of movement: (1) an affective movement (fearful face), (2) a neutral movement (close-lipped, puffed cheeks with open eyes), and (3) a biologically impossible movement (upward dislocation of eyes and mouth). To determine whether early brain responses sensitive to low-level visual features differed between the expressions, we measured the occipital P100 event-related potential, which is known to reflect differences in early stages of visual processing, and the N170, which reflects structural encoding of faces. We found no differences between the faces at the P100, indicating that different face categories were well matched on low-level image properties.

Also, the two types of expressions did not differ across a wide range of measures collected: aptness, conventionality, familiarity, and interpretive diversity scores.

In order of importance, these dimensions are evaluation-pleasantness, potency-control, activation-arousal, and unpredictability. They were identified on the basis of the applicability of 144 features representing the six components of emotions: (a) appraisals of events, (b) psychophysiological changes, (c) motor expressions, (d) action tendencies, (e) subjective experiences, and (f) emotion regulation."

An associative frequency measure was calculated by counting how many participants produced a particular word and then converting this number into a proportion. The degree of overlap between the cohorts in terms of dominant responses, the responses with the highest association frequencies, was moderate. Dominant responses were common to the two cohorts for only 36 of the 90 items. When the top three responses were considered the degree of overlap increased to approximately 60{\%}. Four measures of response heterogeneity were calculated for each stimulus item. Comparison of the responses of the younger and older adults indicates that there was less response heterogeneity amongst the older cohort.

Despite this preference, we know little about what frequency norms measure. They ostensibly index how often and how recently words are experienced, but words appear in context, so frequency potentially reflects an influence of connections with other words. This paper presents the results of a large free association study as well as the results of experiments designed to evaluate the hypothesis that common words have stronger connections to other words. The norms indicate that common words tend to be more concrete but they do not appear to have more associates, stronger associates, or more connections among their associates. Two extralist cued recall experiments showed that, with other attributes being equal, high- and low-frequency words were equally effective as test cues. These results suggest that frequency does not achieve its effects because of stronger or greater numbers of connections to other words, as implied in SAM. Other results indicated that common words have more connections from other words, including their associates, and that free association provides a valid index of associative strength."

Two Italian actors (male and female) then recorded the resulting subset of linguistically legal and neutral pseudowords in three emotional tones. Finally, on the basis of the results of independent ratings of emotional intensity, we selected a set of 30 audio stimuli expressed in each of the three different emotions. Acoustic analyses indicated that the prosodic indexes of fundamental frequency, vocal intensity, and speech rate anchored individual perceptions of the emotions expressed. Finally, the acoustic profile of the set of emotional stimuli confirmed previous findings. The happy tone stimuli showed high f0 values, high intensity, high pitch variability, and a faster speech rate. The angry tone stimuli were also characterized by high f0 and intensity, but by relatively smaller pitch variability and a lower speech rate. This last profile echoes the description of ""cold anger."" This new set of prosodic emotion stimuli will constitute a useful resource for future research that requires emotional prosody materials.

Such a database is essential in minimizing the risk that low-level features drive high-level effects of interest, which is being discussed as possible source of controversial study results. To generate the first database of this kind - SCEGRAM - we took photographs of 62 real-world indoor scenes in six consistency conditions that contain semantic and syntactic (both mild and extreme) violations as well as their combinations. Importantly, always two scenes were paired, so that an object was semantically consistent in one scene (e.g., ketchup in kitchen) and inconsistent in the other (e.g., ketchup in bathroom). Low-level salience did not differ between object-scene conditions and was generally moderate. Additionally, SCEGRAM contains consistency ratings for every object-scene condition, as well as object-absent scenes and object-only images. Finally, a cross-validation using eye-movements replicated previous results of longer dwell times for both semantic and syntactic inconsistencies compared to consistent controls. In sum, the SCEGRAM image database is the first to contain well-controlled semantic and syntactic object-scene inconsistencies that can be used in a broad range of cognitive paradigms (e.g., verbal and pictorial priming, change detection, object identification, etc.) including paradigms addressing developmental aspects of scene grammar.

This study employs pan-respondent component analyses as a means of examining the respondents' usage of the standard EPA scales. The pan-respondent component analyses indicate that some respondents used the rating scales in unexpected ways, recording their feelings about one component of concepts' EPA with ratings on a scale intended to measure a different dimension. When scores were based only on respondents who used the scales appropriately, several interesting patterns were found. For respondents of both genders, potency scores have a curvilinear relation with evaluation, such that very good and very bad concepts are mostly seen as very potent, whereas evaluatively neutral concepts are seen as somewhat impotent or just slightly potent. A moderate linear correlation exists between activity and evaluation, and a modest positive relation exists between potency and activity. Gender correlations are high on evaluation, .93, but much lower for potency scores, with a correlation of .55, and even lower for activity, .30. In this article we examine several explanations for why scales denoting potency and activity were reinterpreted as indicating goodness by certain respondents, and consider the matter of including data collected from respondents who used scales in this way."

In this article, we provide normative data for a set of Bulgarian idioms and their English translations, and by doing so replicate in a Slavic language the relationships between the ratings previously found in Romance and Germanic languages. Additionally, we compared whether collecting these types of ratings in between-subjects or within-subjects designs affects the data and the conclusions drawn, and found no evidence that design type affects the final outcome. Finally, we present the results of a meta-analysis that summarizes the relationships found across the literature. As in many previous individual studies, we found that familiarity correlates with a number of other features; however, such studies have shown conflicting results concerning literality and decomposability ratings. The meta-analysis revealed reliable relationships of decomposability with a number of other measures, such as familiarity, meaning, and predictability. Conversely, literality was shown to have little to no relationship with any of the other subjective ratings. The implications for these relationships in the context of the wider experimental literature are discussed, with a particular focus on the importance of attaining familiarity ratings for each sample of participants in experimental work."

The results from Study 1 were employed to develop the final version of the SFIP, which includes fear-relevant images of social exposure (N = 40), blood/injection (N = 80), spiders/bugs (N = 80), and angry faces (N = 30), as well as 726 neutral photographs. In Study 2, we aimed to validate the SFIP in a sample of spider, blood/injection, social-fearful, and control individuals (N = 66).

Much of this research has focused on whether compound words are decomposed during recognition by manipulating the word frequencies of their lexemes. However, many variables may impact morphological processing, including relational semantic variables such as semantic transparency, as well as additional form-related and semantic variables. In the present study, ratings were collected on 629 English compound words for six variables [familiarity, age of acquisition (AoA), semantic transparency, lexeme meaning dominance (LMD), imageability, and sensory experience ratings (SER)]. All of the compound words selected for this study are contained within the English Lexicon Project (Balota et al., 2007), which made it possible to use a regression approach to examine the predictive power of these variables for lexical decision and word naming performance. Analyses indicated that familiarity, AoA, imageability, and SER were all significant predictors of both lexical decision and word naming performance when they were added separately to a model containing the length and frequency of the compounds, as well as the lexeme frequencies. In addition, rated semantic transparency also predicted lexical decision performance. The database of English compound words should be beneficial to word recognition researchers who are interested in selecting items for experiments on compound words, and it will also allow researchers to conduct further analyses using the available data combined with word recognition times included in the English Lexicon Project."

Analysis of the properties of the ANPST dataset showed that norms collected are reliable in terms of split-half estimation and that the distributions of ratings are similar to those obtained in other affective norms studies. The pattern of correlations was the same as that found in analysis of an affective norms dataset for words based on the same six variables. Female psychology students' valence ratings were also more polarized than those of their female student peers studying other subjects, but arousal ratings were only higher for negative words. Differences also appeared for all other measured dimensions.

Quantifying similarity, however, is challenging when everyday items are the desired stimulus set, particularly when researchers require several different pictures from the same category.

We collected similarity ratings using the spatial arrangement method. Reports include: the multidimensional scaling solutions for each category, up to five dimensions, stress and fit measures, coordinate locations for each stimulus, and two new classifications. For each picture, we categorized the item's prototypicality, indexed by its proximity to other items in the space. We also classified pairs of images along a continuum of similarity, by assessing the overall arrangement of each MDS space. These similarity ratings will be useful to any researcher that wishes to control the similarity of experimental stimuli according to an objective quantification of “sameness.”"

Both the first and second pairs of words in a four-word CY form an SV, a VO, or an SM. In the present study, normative measures were obtained for knowledge, familiarity, subjective frequency, age of acquisition, predictability, literality, and compositionality for 350 CYs, and the influences of the CYs' syntactic structures on the descriptive norms were analyzed. Consistent with previous studies, all of the norms yielded a high reliability, and there were strong correlations between knowledge, familiarity, subjective frequency, and age of acquisition, and between familiarity and predictability. Unlike in previous studies (e.g., Libben {\&} Titone in Memory {\&} Cognition, 36, 1103–1121, 2008), however, we observed a strong correlation between literality and compositionality. In general, the results seem to support a hybrid view of idiom representation and comprehension. According to the evaluation scores, we further concluded that CYs consisting of just one SM are less likely to be decomposable than those with a VOVO composition, and also less likely to be recognized through their constituent words, or to be familiar to, known by, or encountered by users. CYs with an SMSM composition are less likely than VOVO CYs to be decomposable or to be known or encountered by users.

One major limitation of gesture investigations in the existing literature lies in the fact that the coding of forms and functions of gestures has not been clearly differentiated. This paper first described a recently developed Database of Speech and GEsture (DoSaGE) based on independent annotation of gesture forms and functions among 119 neurologically unimpaired right-handed native speakers of Cantonese (divided into three age and two education levels), and presented findings of an investigation examining how gesture use was related to age and linguistic performance. Consideration of these two factors, for which normative data are currently very limited or lacking in the literature, is relevant and necessary when one evaluates gesture employment among individuals with and without language impairment. Three speech tasks, including monologue of a personally important event, sequential description, and story-telling, were used for elicitation. The EUDICO Linguistic ANnotator (ELAN) software was used to independently annotate each participant's linguistic information of the transcript, forms of gestures used, and the function for each gesture. About one-third of the subjects did not use any co-verbal gestures. While the majority of gestures were non-content-carrying, which functioned mainly for reinforcing speech intonation or controlling speech flow, the content-carrying ones were used to enhance speech content. Furthermore, individuals who are younger or linguistically more proficient tended to use fewer gestures, suggesting that normal speakers gesture differently as a function of age and linguistic performance."

To demonstrate the utility of Silex, we first described the silent-letter phenomenon in French. We found that, at minimum, 28 {\%} of French words end with a silent letter. Moreover, silent-letter endings are usually t, e, s, x, or d, and the occurrence of these letters is conditioned by the phonological ending of words. Second, we showed how Silex could prove useful for the development of theoretical models and for empirical studies. The novel information provided in Silex as well as the flexibility of this database should enable researchers to advance our understanding of developing and skilled spelling performance."

We present data that suggest that reporting normative data, based on methodological procedures that ask participants to consider multiple image constructs simultaneously, could potentially confounded norm data. We provide data for two new image constructs, beauty and the extent to which participants encountered the stimuli in their everyday lives. Analysis of this data suggests that familiarity and encounter are tapping different image constructs. The extent to which an observer encounters an object predicts human judgments of visual complexity. Encountering an image was also found to be an important predictor of beauty, but familiarity with that image was not. Taken together, these results suggest that continuing to collect complexity measures from human judgments is a pointless exercise. Automated measures are more reliable and valid measures, which are demonstrated here as predicting human preferences."

After each pose, the models completed the PANAS questionnaire, and reported more positive affect after smiling and more negative affect after frowning. From the shooting material, stills and 5 s and 10 s videos were edited (total stimulus set = 180). A different sample of 120 participants evaluated the stimuli for attractiveness, arousal, clarity, genuineness, familiarity, intensity, valence, and similarity. Overall, facial expression had a main effect in all of the evaluated dimensions, with smiling models obtaining the highest ratings. Frowning expressions were perceived as being more arousing, clearer, and more intense, but also as more negative than neutral expressions. Stimulus presentation format only influenced the ratings of attractiveness, familiarity, genuineness, and intensity. The attractiveness and familiarity ratings increased with longer exposure times, whereas genuineness decreased. The ratings in the several dimensions were correlated. The subjective norms of facial stimuli presented in this article have potential applications to the work of researchers in several research domains.

In recent years, several affective norms have been developed from a dimensional perspective, including ratings for valence and arousal. In contrast, the number of published datasets relying on the discrete-emotion approach is much lower. There is a need to fill this gap, considering that discrete emotions have an effect on word processing above and beyond those of valence and arousal. In the present study, we present ratings from 1,380 participants for a set of 2,266 Spanish words in five discrete emotion categories: happiness, anger, fear, disgust, and sadness. This will be the largest dataset published to date containing ratings for discrete emotions. We also present, for the first time, a fine-grained analysis of the distribution of words into the five emotion categories. This analysis reveals that happiness words are the most consistently related to a single, discrete emotion category. In contrast, there is a tendency for many negative words to belong to more than one discrete emotion. The only exception is disgust words, which overlap least with the other negative emotions. Normative valence and arousal data already exist for all of the words included in this corpus. Thus, the present database will allow researchers to design studies to contrast the predictions of the two most influential theoretical perspectives in this field.

Previous studies have often collected relatively small numbers of grapheme–color associations per synesthete, but the accumulation of a large quantity of data has greater promise for uncovering the mechanisms underlying synesthetic association. In this study, we therefore collected large samples of data from a total of eight synesthetes. All told, we obtained over 1000 synesthetic colors associated with Japanese kanji characters from each of two synesthetes, over 100 synesthetic colors form each of three synesthetes, and about 80 synesthetic colors associated with Japanese hiragana, Latin letters, and Arabic numerals from each of three synesthetes.

Data were collected online through a process involving 826 university students. The results showed a high interrater reliability for all of the variables examined, as well as high correlations between our affective and semantic values and norms currently available in other Spanish databases. Regarding the affective variables, the typical quadratic correlation between valence and arousal ratings was obtained. Likewise, significant correlations were found between the lexico-semantic variables.

Yet, the discipline lacks a validated set of moral violations that span the moral domain, creating a barrier to investigating influences on judgment and how their neural bases might vary across the moral domain. In this paper, we aim to fill this gap by developing and validating a large set of moral foundations vignettes (MFVs). Each vignette depicts a behavior violating a particular moral foundation and not others. The vignettes are controlled on many dimensions including syntactic structure and complexity making them suitable for neuroimaging research. We demonstrate the validity of our vignettes by examining respondents' classifications of moral violations, conducting exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis, and demonstrating the correspondence between the extracted factors and existing measures of the moral foundations.

This study provides affective and psycholinguistic norms for 619 German idiomatic expressions and explores the relationships between affective and psycholinguistic idiom properties. German native speakers rated each idiom for emotional valence, arousal, familiarity, semantic transparency, figurativeness, and concreteness. They also described the figurative meaning of each idiom and rated how confident they were about the attributed meaning. The results showed that idioms rated high in valence were also rated high in arousal. Negative idioms were rated as more arousing than positive ones, in line with results from single words. Furthermore, arousal correlated positively with figurativeness (supporting the idea that figurative expressions are more emotionally engaging than literal expressions) and with concreteness and semantic transparency. This suggests that idioms may convey a more direct reference to sensory representations, mediated by the meanings of their constituting words. Arousal correlated positively with familiarity. In addition, positive idioms were rated as more familiar than negative idioms. Finally, idioms without a literal counterpart were rated as more emotionally valenced and arousing than idioms with a literal counterpart. Although the meanings of ambiguous idioms were less correctly defined than those of unambiguous idioms, ambiguous idioms were rated as more concrete than unambiguous ones.

Although fields such as computer science have developed a range of techniques and methods for handling these difficulties, making use of those tools has often required specialized knowledge and programming experience. The Text Analysis, Crawling, and Interpretation Tool (TACIT) is designed to bridge this gap by providing an intuitive tool and interface for making use of state-of-the-art methods in text analysis and large-scale data management.

The findings of this study provide predictive validation of TAACO and support the notion that expert judgments of text coherence and quality are either negatively correlated or not predicted by local and overall text cohesion indices, but are positively predicted by global indices of cohesion. Combined, these findings provide supporting evidence that coherence for expert raters is a property of global cohesion and not of local cohesion, and that expert ratings of text quality are positively related to global cohesion."

Semantic distance was found to correlate weakly with these other measures but to correlate more strongly with another measure of semantic relatedness, featural similarity. Hierarchical clustering analysis suggested that the knowledge structure underlying semantic distance is similar in gross form to that underlying featural similarity.

It differs from classical analyses of phonological neighborhood density (e.g., Luce {\&} Pisoni, 1998) by assuming that not all phonological neighbors are equal. Rather, it is assumed that the phonological lexicon has psycholinguistic structure. Accordingly, in addition to considering the number of phonological neighbors for any given word, it becomes important to consider the nature of these neighbors. If one type of neighbor is more dominant, neighborhood density effects may reflect levels of segmental representation other than the phoneme, particularly prior to literacy. Statistical analyses of the nature of phonological neighborhoods in terms of rime neighbors (e.g., hat/cat), consonant neighbors (e.g., hat/hit), and lead neighbors (e.g., hat/ham) were thus performed for all monosyllabic words in the Celex corpus (4,086 words). Our results show that most phonological neighbors are rime neighbors (e.g., hat/cat) in English. Similar patterns were found when a corpus of words for which age-of-acquisition ratings were available was analyzed.

"Lewis, Michael B.",Visual Cognition,chasing psycholinguistic effects a cautionary tale,2006,"Many studies have addressed the issue of whether age of acquisition and/ or frequency affect particular lexical tasks. Methods typically employed in such studies are based on the general linear model (e.g., ANOVA or multiple regression). These methods assume manipulated independent variables whereas the usual approach of investigating age-of-acquisition and frequency effects uses estimated norms of word properties. This failure to truly manipulate variables violate the assumptions of the analyses. A simulation is provided that demonstrates how this violation can lead to erroneous conclusions of effects when none are present. Recommendations are made for a more correlational approach to analysis using structural equation modelling techniques. It is also discussed how this use of estimates of lexical data is problematic for determining effects throughout psycholinguistic research. {\textcopyright} 2006 Psychology Press Ltd."

The young and older groups also rated each word with respect to the frequency of encounters in different perceptual domains (e.g., reading, hearing, writing, or speaking). The results of regression analyses indicated that objective log frequency and meaningfulness accounted for most of the variance in subjective frequency estimates, whereas neighborhood size accounted for the least amount of variance in the ratings. The predictive power of log frequency and meaningfulness were dependent on the level of subjective frequency estimates. Meaningfulness was a better predictor of subjective frequency for uncommon words, whereas log frequency was a better predictor of subjective frequency for common words. Our discussion focuses on the utility of subjective frequency estimates compared with other estimates of familiarity.

However, the investigation of how we process these vocal cues entered the research agenda only recently. Here, we introduce a new corpus of nonverbal vocalizations, which we recorded and submitted to perceptual and acoustic validation. It consists of 121 sounds expressing four positive emotions (achievement/triumph, amusement, sensual pleasure, and relief) and four negative ones (anger, disgust, fear, and sadness), produced by two female and two male speakers. For perceptual validation, a forced choice task was used (n = 20), and ratings were collected for the eight emotions, valence, arousal, and authenticity (n = 20). We provide these data, detailed for each vocalization, for use by the research community. High recognition accuracy was found for all emotions (86 {\%}, on average), and the sounds were reliably rated as communicating the intended expressions. The vocalizations were measured for acoustic cues related to temporal aspects, intensity, fundamental frequency (f0), and voice quality. These cues alone provide sufficient information to discriminate between emotion categories, as indicated by statistical classification procedures; they are also predictors of listeners' emotion ratings, as indicated by multiple regression analyses. This set of stimuli seems a valuable addition to currently available expression corpora for research on emotion processing.

Because writing is often highly nuanced and subjective, the development of these algorithms must consider a broad array of linguistic, rhetorical, and contextual features. This study assesses the potential for computational indices to predict human ratings of essay quality. Past studies have demonstrated that linguistic indices related to lexical diversity, word frequency, and syntactic complexity are significant predictors of human judgments of essay quality but that indices of cohesion are not. The present study extends prior work by including a larger data sample and an expanded set of indices to assess new lexical, syntactic, cohesion, rhetorical, and reading ease indices. Three models were assessed. The model reported by McNamara, Crossley, and McCarthy (Written Communication 27:57-86, 2010) including three indices of lexical diversity, word frequency, and syntactic complexity accounted for only 6{\%} of the variance in the larger data set. A regression model including the full set of indices examined in prior studies of writing predicted 38{\%} of the variance in human scores of essay quality with 91{\%} adjacent accuracy (i.e., within 1 point). A regression model that also included new indices related to rhetoric and cohesion predicted 44{\%} of the variance with 94{\%} adjacent accuracy. The new indices increased accuracy but, more importantly, afford the means to provide more meaningful feedback in the context of a writing tutoring system."

Experiment 1 yielded early (P2) and late (N400, late positive component/LPC) emotional word effects. Concreteness affected the N400 and the LPC. In line with the extended dual coding model and with previous studies, the N400 effect represents greater semantic activation, whereas the LPC effect may result from mental imagery being activated by concrete words. Experiment 2 engaged participants in a go/no-go task pressing a button for pseudowords. Here, emotionality and concreteness modulated the N400 independently, but interacted in the LPC time window.

Discourse psychologists often investigate phenomena related to discourse processing using lengthy texts containing multiple paragraphs, as opposed to single word and sentence stimuli. Characterizing such texts in terms of cohesion and coherence is challenging. Some computational tools are available, but they are either fragmented over different databases or they assess single, specific features of text. Coh-Metrix is a computational linguistic tool that measures text cohesion and text difficulty on a range of word, sentence, paragraph, and discourse dimensions. This study investigated the validity of Coh-Metrix as a measure of cohesion in text using stimuli from published discourse psychology studies as a benchmark. Results showed that Coh-Metrix indexes of cohesion (individually and combined) significantly distinguished the high- versus low-cohesion versions of these texts. The results also showed that commonly used readability indexes (e.g., Flesch-Kincaid) inappropriately distinguished between low- and high-cohesion texts.

Words with more right-side letters were rated as more positive in valence, on average, than words with more left-side letters: the QWERTY effect. This effect was strongest in new words coined after QWERTY was invented and was also found in pseudowords.

Matching large groups of items or participants on multiple dimensions is a difficult and time-consuming task, yet failure to match conditions will lead to suboptimal experiments. We describe a computer program, ""Match"", that automates this process by selecting the best-matching items from larger sets of candidate items. In most cases, the program produces near-optimal solutions in amatter of minutes and selects matches that are typically superior to those obtained using hand matching or other semiautomated processes. We report the results of a case study in which Match was used to generate matched sets of experimental items (words varying in length and frequency) for a published study on language processing. The program was able to come up with better-matching item sets than those hand-selected by the authors of the original study, and in a fraction of the time originally taken up with stimulus matching."

One of the simplest sentiment analysis approaches compares the words of a posting against a labeled word list, where each word has been scored for valence, -- a 'sentiment lexicon' or 'affective word lists'. There exist several affective word lists, e.g., ANEW (Affective Norms for English Words) developed before the advent of microblogging and sentiment analysis. I wanted to examine how well ANEW and other word lists performs for the detection of sentiment strength in microblog posts in comparison with a new word list specifically constructed for microblogs.

Using a simple word matching I show that the new word list may perform better than ANEW, though not as good as the more elaborate approach found in SentiStrength."

Subjects verified whether “A(n) A is a(n) B” when A was an ambiguous word and B was a word corresponding to either a dominant or an unusual semantic sense of word A. When word B most often corresponded to the dominant sense of word A (Experiment I), a Priming by Dominance interaction was obtained in the reaction time (RT) data; viz, the facilitatory effect of priming was greater for the dominant-sense sentences than for the unusual-sense sentences. When the word B equally often corresponded to the dominant and unusual senses of A (Experiment 2), the facilitatory effect of priming was equal for the dominant-sense and unusual-sense sentences. These results were interpreted within the framework of a two-stage model of lexical access (d. Posner {\&} Snyder, 1975; Neely, 1977).

In several studies, when the participant did not provide the picture name in the first seconds after object presentation, the examiner provided phonemic or semantic cues.

The goal of the present study was to collect objective norms of AoA in French without any kind of cue. The results were then compared with other European databases that relied on picture-naming tasks conducted with phonemic or semantic cues. Globally, the data of all the databases are significantly correlated. However, the AoA measures in these databases are always lower than in our study, except in Alvarez and Cuetos (2007), who did not provide any assistance to the participant. Therefore, giving phonemic and/or semantic cues lowers the AoA values, indicating that the values from different databases in this domain should be taken with caution.

A consequence is that the interpretation of the two classical measures used by Snodgrass and Vanderwart (1980) for scoring name agreement in adults (the percentage of agreement, based on modal name, and the H statistic, based on alternative names) will differ because of the high rate of ""don't know object"" responses, common in young children, relative to the low rate of ""don't know object"" responses more characteristic of adults. The present study focused on this methodological issue in young French children (3-8 years old), using a set of 145 Snodgrass-Vanderwart pictures.

Linguistic and experiential frequencies were equivalent. Rated familiarity was lower for UM than KM words and even lower for U words. Next, we built pseudowords from these stimuli by changing one letter and submitted them to two familiarity rating tasks that differed in the nature of the additional stimuli: either only nonwords or nonwords plus words. It was assumed that familiarity ratings would be lower for pseudowords built from UM words than for pseudowords built from KM words. The data were consistent with this assumption, and ratings depended on the initial categories of stimuli.

Yet, the main criterion for selecting word frequency norms has been the availability of the measure, rather than its quality. As a result, much research is still based on the old Kucera and Francis frequency norms. By using the lexical decision times of recently published megastudies, we show how bad this measure is and what must be done to improve it. In particular, we investigated the size of the corpus, the language register on which the corpus is based, and the definition of the frequency measure. We observed that corpus size is of practical importance for small sizes (depending on the frequency of the word), but not for sizes above 16-30 million words. As for the language register, we found that frequencies based on television and film subtitles are better than frequencies based on written sources, certainly for the monosyllabic and bisyllabic words used in psycholinguistic research. Finally, we found that lemma frequencies are not superior to word form frequencies in English and that a measure of contextual diversity is better than a measure based on raw frequency of occurrence. Part of the superiority of the latter is due to the words that are frequently used as names. Assembling a new frequency norm on the basis of these considerations turned out to predict word processing times much better than did the existing norms (including Kucera {\&} Francis and Celex).

Although printed frequency norms have long been available for Spanish, and subtitle-based norms have more recently been published, oral frequency norms have not been systematically compiled for a representative set of words. In this study, a corpus of over three million units, representing present-day use of the language in Spain, was used to derive a frequency count of spoken words. The corpus consisted of 913 separate documents that contained transcriptions of oral recordings obtained in a wide variety of situations, mostly radio and television programs. The resulting database, containing absolute and relative frequency values for 67,979 orally produced words, is presented. Validity analyses showed significant correlations of oral frequency with other frequency measures and suggest that oral frequency can predict some types of lexical processing with the same or higher levels of precision, when contrasted with text- or subtitle-based frequencies. In conclusion, we discuss ways in which these oral frequency norms can be put to use. The norms can be downloaded from www.springerlink.com."

First, our results show that the multiple-response procedure results in a more heterogeneous set of responses, which lead to better predictions of lexical access and semantic relatedness than do single-response procedures. Second, the directed nature of the network leads to a decomposition of centrality that primarily depends on the number of incoming links or in-degree of each node, rather than its set size or number of outgoing links.

The present article provides normative measures for 400 line drawings viewed by 5- and 6-year-old children. The three variables obtained - name agreement, familiarity, and visual complexity - are important because of their potential effect on memory and other cognitive processes. The normative data collected in the present study indicate that young children are different from adults in both the name most frequently assigned and the number of alternative names provided. The alternative names given by the children are either coordinate names or names of objects that are visually similar to the pictured object. In addition, the failure (to name) rate is higher among young children compared to adults. Thus, we conclude that unequivocal interpretation of age-related differences in cognitive functions can be made only when age-appropriate pictorial stimuli are chosen. {\textcopyright} 1997 Academic Press."

The two instruments, one designed for 8-16-month-old infants, the other for 16-30-month-old toddlers, are both reliable and valid, confirming the value of parent reports that are based on contemporary behavior and a recognition format. Growth trends are described for children scoring at the 10th-, 25th-, 50th-, 75th-, and 90th-percentile levels on receptive and expressive vocabulary, actions and gestures, and a number of aspects of morphology and syntax. Extensive variability exists in the rate of lexical, gestural, and grammatical development. The wide variability across children in the time of onset and course of acquisition of these skills challenges the meaningfulness of the concept of the modal child. At the same time, moderate to high intercorrelations are found among the different skills both concurrently and predictively (across a 6-month period). Sex differences consistently favor females; however, these are very small, typically accounting for 1{\%}-2{\%} of the variance. The effects of SES and birth order are even smaller within this age range. The inventories offer objective criteria for defining typicality and exceptionality, and their cost effectiveness facilitates the aggregation of large data sets needed to address many issues of contemporary theoretical interest. The present data also offer unusually detailed information on the course of development of individual lexical, gestural, and grammatical items and features. Adaptations of the CDIs to other languages have opened new possibilities for cross-linguistic explorations of sequence, rate, and variability of communicative development."

Such measures are somewhat subjective and may not adequately capture the full extent of variation in word meaning, particularly for polysemous words that can be used in many different ways, with subtle shifts in meaning. Here, we describe an alternative, computationally derived measure of ambiguity based on the proposal that the meanings of words vary continuously as a function of their contexts. On this view, words that appear in a wide range of contexts on diverse topics are more variable in meaning than those that appear in a restricted set of similar contexts. To quantify this variation, we performed latent semantic analysis on a large text corpus to estimate the semantic similarities of different linguistic contexts. From these estimates, we calculated the degree to which the different contexts associated with a given word vary in their meanings. We term this quantity a word's semantic diversity (SemD). We suggest that this approach provides an objective way of quantifying the subtle, context-dependent variations in word meaning that are often present in language. We demonstrate that SemD is correlated with other measures of ambiguity and contextual variability, as well as with frequency and imageability. We also show that SemD is a strong predictor of performance in semantic judgments in healthy individuals and in patients with semantic deficits, accounting for unique variance beyond that of other predictors.

The results demonstrate that rated prototypicality is related to both the familiarity of the concept and its distance from the average of the exemplars within the same category (the category centroid). The feature database was also used to replicate, resolve, and extend a variety of previous observations on the structure of semantic representations. Specifically, the results of our analyses (1) resolve two conflicting claims regarding the relative ratio of sensory to other kinds of attributes in living vs. nonliving concepts; (2) offer new information regarding the types of features-across different domains-that distinguish concepts from their category coordinates; and (3) corroborate some previous claims of higher intercorrelations between features of living things than those of artefacts."

In Exps II, III, and IV, internal structure was found to affect the perceptual encoding of physically identical pairs of stimuli, facilitating responses to physically identical good members and hindering responses to identical poor members of a category. Exps V and VI showed that the category name did not generate a physical code (e.g., lines or angles), but rather affected perception of the stimuli at the level of meaning. Exps VII and VIII showed that while the representation of the category name which affected perception contained a depth meaning common to words and pictures which enabled Ss to prepare for either stimulus form within 700 msec, selective reduction of the interval between prime and stimulus below 700 msec revealed differentiation of the coding of meaning in preparation for actual perception.

Although some letter visual-similarity matrices have been constructed using data gathered from normal reading conditions, these either are based on old fonts, which may not resemble the letters found in modern print, or were never published. For the first time, this article presents a comprehensive letter visual-similarity/confusability matrix that has been constructed based on untimed responses to clearly presented upper- and lowercase letters that are present in many languages that use Latin-based alphabets, including Catalan, Dutch, English, French, Galician, German, Italian, Portuguese, and Spanish. Such a matrix will be useful for researchers interested in the processes underpinning reading and literacy acquisition."
"Bonneau-Maynard, H.",Speech Communication,vector quantization for speaker adaptation results on a 5000 word database,1991,"With a view to designing a speaker-independent large vocabulary recognition system, we evaluate a vector quantization approach for speaker adaptation. Only one speaker (the reference speaker) pronounces the application vocabulary. He also pronounces a small vocabulary called the adaptation vocabulary. Each new speaker then merely pronounces the adaptation vocabulary. We have compared two adaptation methods, establishing a correspondence between the codebooks of the reference and the new speakers, on a 20-speaker database with a 104-word application vocabulary. Method I uses a transposed codebook to represent the new speaker during the recognition process, whereas Method II uses a codebook which is obtained by clustering analysis on the NS's pronunciation of the adaptation vocabulary. The adaptation vocabulary contains 136 words. Comparison of the performance of the two methods shows that a new speaker's codebook is not necessary to represent the new speaker. Consequently we have used the first method to perform tests with a 5000-word application vocabulary, and a 4-speaker database. The adaptation is still efficient (the mean improvement is about 14{\%}), even if the relative improvement is 30{\%} compared to 56{\%} obtained in the 104-word application experiment. Further experiments show that the recognition accuracy can be improved by increasing the adaptation vocabulary size and the codebook size. {\textcopyright} 1991."

This paper investigates the current software architecture of Twitter system and put forward a new architecture dedicated for semantic and spatial analysis of Twitter data. Especially, Twitter Streaming API was used as a basis for tweet collection data stored in MySQL like database. While Lucene system together with WordNet lexical database linked to advanced natural language processing and PostGIS platform were used to ensure semantic and spatial analysis of the collected data. A functional diversity approach was implemented to enforce fault tolerance for the data collection part where its performances were evaluated through comparison with alternative approaches.

Name agreement, familiarity and visual complexity ratings were obtained. These variables have been shown to be important for the selection of adequate stimuli for cognitive studies. Children's name agreement was lower than that of adults. The children also failed to provide adequate modal names for 103 concepts, rated drawings as less familiar and less complex, and chose shorter names for pictures. The differences in ratings between adults and children were higher than those observed in the literature employing smaller picture sets.

In Experiment 1, 5-year-olds made age-of-acquisition (AOA) estimates for a set of words that were very similar to estimates made by older children and adults. In Experiment 2, young children's picture recognition, mispronunciation detection, and vocabulary monitoring performance all varied systematically with these AOA estimates and with a stimulus-type (intact-mispronounced) manipulation. Subjective AOA estimates (whether from children or from adults) proved to be a better predictor of performance than did two objective familiarity measures and subjective imageability. These results point to considerable metalexical knowledge on the part of young children or explicit sensitivity regarding their own vocabulary knowledge. In addition, the results lend some support to the notion that actual AOA contributes to subjective AOA estimates."

The work involves locating all verbs and their nominalizations in the corpus, and semi-automatically adding semantic role labels to their arguments, which are constituents in a parse tree. Although the same procedure is followed, different issues arise in the annotation of verbs and nominalized predicates. For verbs, identifying their arguments is generally straightforward given their syntactic structure in the Chinese Treebank as they tend to occupy well-defined syntactic positions. Our discussion focuses on the syntactic variations in the realization of the arguments as well as our approach to annotating dislocated and discontinuous arguments. In comparison, identifying the arguments for nominalized predicates is more challenging and we discuss criteria and procedures for distinguishing arguments from non-arguments. In particular we focus on the role of support verbs as well as the relevance of event/result distinctions in the annotation of the predicate-argument structure of nominalized predicates. We also present our approach to taking advantage of the syntactic structure in the Chinese Treebank to bootstrap the predicate-argument structure annotation of verbs. Finally, we discuss the creation of a lexical database of frame files and its role in guiding predicate-argument annotation. Procedures for ensuring annotation consistency and inter-annotator agreement evaluation results are also presented."

Two ways of estimating this variable are (1) objective frequency counts and (2) subjective ratings of word frequency. Each method produces estimates that generally agree (i.e., they are highly correlated) but that disagree substantially concerning the relative frequency of a number of words. To investigate this issue more closely, the global and local agreement of subjective frequency estimates was examined in detail for a pool of 6,202 words drawn from the OMNILEX database of French words (Desrochers, 2006; www.omnilex.uottawa.ca). The results indicated that objective and subjective frequencies are strongly correlated, subjective frequencies share a significant amount of bias variance with other lexical characteristics (e.g., imageability), and the codeterminants of subjective frequency are in an antagonistic relationship with one another. The implications of these results for the selection of lexical stimuli are discussed, and multiple variables to aid in item selection are reported.

The purpose of the current work was to provide a set of normative data for the lists Roediger and McDermott used and for 12 others developed more recently. We tested false recall and false recognition for critical targets from 36 lists. Despite the fact that all lists were constructed to produce false remembering, the diversity in their effectiveness was large--60{\%} or more of subjects falsely recalled window and sleep following the appropriate lists, and false recognition for these items was greater than 80{\%}. However, the list generated from king led to 10{\%} false recall and 27{\%} false recognition. Possible reasons for these wide differences in effectiveness of the lists are discussed.

The present study provided for essentially the same analyses with different long-term data obtained with two individuals, the primary intent being to examine the ability of recognition and scaling models to explain data at the individual level (which the recognition models purport to describe) and to compare the confusion characteristics of the English uppercase alphabet between the two Ss and between the individual Ss and the group-averaged data. The choice and overlap models were superior to the all-or-none model in predicting the empirical confusion matrices and tended to explain the data structure in a similar manner. Multidimensional scaling analysis again supported a Euclidean metric and suggested four or five underlying stimulus dimensions. However, as before, there were no overriding intuitively appealing psychological dimensions corresponding to these, and possible reasons are discussed. The choice and overlap models appeared to fit as well or better at the individual level than at the group level and the all-or-none model to fit worse. In the present study, probability correct was fit even better by the all-or-none model than in the group study and replicated the result of being better here than the overlap and choice models. Individuals and the group were consistent in their sensory confusions as represented by similarity parameters in the choice and overlap models but differed in their response biases.

"Townsend, J. T.",Perception {\&} Psychophysics,theoretical analysis of an alphabetic confusion matrix,1971,"A study was undertaken to acquire a confusion matrix of the entire upper-case English alphabet with a simple nonserifed font under tachistoscopic conditions. This was accomplished with two experimental conditions, one with blank poststimulus field and one with noisy poststimulus field, for six Ss run 650 trials each. Three mathematical models of recognition, two based on the concept of a finite number of sensory states and one being the choice model, were compared in their ability to predict the confusion matrix after their parameters were estimated from functions of the data. In order to ascertain the facility with which estimates of similarity among the letters could lead to a psychological space containing the letters, $\eta$ ij, the similarity parameter of the choice model was input to an ordinally based multidimensional scaling program. Finally, correlation coefficients were computed among parameters of the models, the scaled space, and a crude measure of physical similarity. Briefly, the results were: (1) the finite-state model that assumed stimulus similarity (the overlap activation model) and the choice model predicted the confusion-matrix entries about equally well in terms of a sum-of-squared deviations criterion and better than the all-or-none activation model, which assumed only a perfect perception or random-guessing state following a stimulus presentation; (2) the parts of the confusion matrix that fit best varied with the particular model, and this finding was related to the models; (3) the best scaling result in terms of a goodness-of-fit measure was obtained with the blank poststimulus field condition, with a technique allowing different distances for tied similarity values, and with the Euclidean as opposed to the city-block metric; and (4) there was agreement among the models in terms of the way in which the models reflected sensory and response bias structure in the data, and in the way in which a single model measured these attributes across experimental conditions, as well as agreement among similarity ami distance measures with physical Similarity. {\textcopyright} 1971 Psychonomic Society, Inc."

"Loomis, Jack M.",Perception {\&} Psychophysics,analysis of tactile and visual confusion matrices,1982,"Confusion matrices were compiled for uppercase letters and for braille characters presented to observers in two ways: as raised touch stimuli and as visual stimuli that had been optically filtered of their higher spatial frequencies. These and other existing matrices were subjected to a number of analyses, including the choice model and hierarchical clustering. The strong similarity of the visual and tactile matrices from this study lends additional support to the claim that visual recognition of low-pass filtered characters, to a first approximation, can be taken as a model of tactile recognition of small two-dimensional raised patterns.

"Loomis, Jack M.",Perception {\&} Psychophysics,tactile letter recognition under different modes of stimulus presentation,1974,"Block capital letters were displayed to experienced and inexperienced Ss, using a 20 x 20 matrix of vibratory tactors placed against the back. In two separate experiments, a total of five modes of stimulus presentation. three of them employing a linear scanning slit, were studied. The poorest method, stationary flashing of the letter, allows performance that is well above chance, implying that a purely spatial presentation does convey information. Performance is improved when the letter is moved horizontally across the display. The best performance is achieved when the amount of simultaneous stimulation is limited by using a linear scanning slit. In one method, the letter moves behind a stationary slit, with the result that its horizontal dimension is portrayed only in time. In the other two methods, the scanning slit moves across the stationary letter, portraying the letter both in time and in space. The results of all five display modes indicate that Ss can use whichever representation, spatial or temporal, is available, although patternings which most closely approximate sequential tracing by a single moving point lead to the highest recognition accuracy. We interpret these results in terms of the limited spatial resolution of the cutaneous sense. While the perception of a letter presented in either full-field condition is limited by the spatial resolution, the best measure being the two-point limen, the perception of a letter traced sequentially is limited by the localization acuity of the cutaneous sense, the best measure being the ""error of localization,"" which is known to be considerably smaller than the two-point limen.

Although several homograph as-sociation norms have been published in the past, none has involved a large number of subjects responding to a large number of homographs, and most homograph norming studies are now at least a decade old. In Experiment 1, associations to 566 homographs were collected from an aver-age of 192 subjects per homograph. Frequency of occurrence for the three most common mean-ings is reported, along with the corresponding associates, and a measure of the overall ambiguity of each homograph. Homographs whose meanings differed in part of speech were more ambigu-ous overall than homographs whose different meanings belonged to a single grammatical class. Homographs whose pronunciation depended on meaning (heterophones) were no more ambigu-ous than nonheterophones, and word frequency was unrelated to overall ambiguity. Estimates of homograph balance across different norming studies were compared, and homographs with two meanings of approximately equal relative meaning frequency (balanced homographs) and homographs with one clearly dominant meaning (polarized homographs) were identified. In Ex-periment 2, reliability of meaning categorizations was measured for a subset of the homographs in the first experiment. Meaning categorizations were shown to be highly reliable across raters. Homographs are words that have more than one mean-ing but share the same orthography. They most often also share phonology (e.g., a dog's bark vs. a tree's bark; a fireplace poker vs. a poker game), but a few English homographs have distinct phonologies for their different meanings. For these heterophonic homographs, pronun-ciation depends on meaning; examples are ""bass"" (fish vs. guitar) and ""wind"" (gale vs. to coil). Contrary to in-tuition, homographs are not an obscure class of linguistic items. Rather, homographs could be considered impor-tant topics of study solely because of their abundance in English.

When using homonyms as stimuli, it is critical to control for the relative frequencies of each interpretation, because this variable can drastically alter the empirical effects of homonymy. Currently, the standard method for estimating these frequencies is based on the classification of free associates generated for a homonym, but this approach is both assumption-laden and resource-demanding. Here, we outline an alternative norming methodology based on explicit ratings of the relative meaning frequencies of dictionary definitions. To evaluate this method, we collected and analyzed data in a norming study involving 544 English homonyms, using the eDom norming software that we developed for this purpose. Dictionary definitions were generally sufficient to exhaustively cover word meanings, and the methods converged on stable norms with fewer data and less effort on the part of the experimenter. The predictive validity of the norms was demonstrated in analyses of lexical decision data from the English Lexicon Project (Balota et al., Behavior Research Methods, 39, 445-459, 2007), and from Armstrong and Plaut (Proceedings of the 33rd Annual Meeting of the Cognitive Science Society, 2223-2228, 2011).

In Exp 1, 96 kindergartners (aged 4.3-6 yrs) generated typicality for items belonging to each of 4 categories. The same Ss participated in Exp 2, in which they were asked to generate attributes for the members of 4 categories for the benefit of 2 people from another planet who had no knowledge about the particular items. In Exp 3, with 120 university students (aged 19-21.3 yrs), the correspondence between adults' family resemblance and typicality ratings on the same materials was tested. Results show that the procedure cannot be reliably used for this purpose; children rated category items in terms of personal preferences rather than as a function of how representative they considered the items to be of their superordinate category. On the basis of these findings, the authors propose an alternative method based on the family resemblance scores of the category members to derive typicality ratings from young children.

Research on item attributes continues to become more sophisticated in a variety of ways, including considera-tion of larger numbers of properties (e.g., Paivio et al., 1989; Rubin, 1980), and serious efforts to model and simulate the effects of stimulus attributes (e.g., Ellis {\&} Lambon Ralph, 2000). Computers have played a central role in both of these developments. The multivariate and simulation studies that might ultimately contribute to the emergence of theoretical models with strong empirical foundations has increased demand for large item pools and increased numbers of properties. The need for a greater number of properties and items follows from the essentially nonexperimental nature of item attribute research. Although researchers may exper-imentally assign different types of materials to different subjects, they generally do not and in some cases cannot experimentally manipulate the property or properties of interest (although such experimental approaches have been used in some cases). Rather, the properties are gen-erally measured in some fashion, and these measures will invariably correlate with other properties that might produce spurious effects or mask the effects of the target attributes. The primary way to address this problem, as in any nonexperimental research, is to identify diverse potentially contaminating constructs, obtain reliable and valid measures, and either control them in the selection of materials or include them in statistical analyses that can accommodate correlated factors (e.g., multiple re-gression, factor analysis, structural equation modeling). In addition to serving this control function, the col-lection of a large number of properties can itself provide information useful in the conceptualization of various item attributes. We can illustrate with one controversial question—the relative importance of frequency and age of acquisition in picture naming and other semantic re-trieval tasks (Morrison {\&} Ellis, 2000). Paivio et al. (1989) obtained picture naming and imagery latencies for a moderate-sized pool of pictures and their most common labels. Information on a wide range of properties, in-cluding age of acquisition, was also obtained. Factor analysis of the results indicated that age of acquisition loaded on several different factors (e.g., familiarity, con-creteness, name length), all of which contributed to pic-ture naming latencies. One interpretation of this result is that age of acquisition is a multidimensional measure that taps a number of distinct properties of words and pictures, hence its superiority to single-component pre-dictors in multiple regression analyses. More specula-tively, one might hypothesize that people rating age of acquisition are actually making judgments of how con-crete, short, and familiar items are, and that children in fact first learn words that tend to be concrete, short, and familiar. Generalization across items provides yet another rea-son to continue the development of item norms for use in cognitive research and theorizing. No single set of norms will ever suffice, because results can depend on the par-ticular pool of items that have been included in the norms. Despite the large corpus of materials on which the Ku{\v{c}}era and Francis (1967) frequency norms are based, for exam-ple, abstract words are still probably overrepresented just because of the types of text that dominate the corpus (e.g., literary and academic materials). It is therefore im-portant to continue to develop additional norms to per-mit evaluation of the generality of findings across di-verse word pools. Another facet of the generalization issue is the possi-bility of generational or cohort differences across ex-tended periods of time. With respect to word familiarity, for example, exposure to and knowledge of particular words might differ today from ratings, like those in the PYM norms, collected during the 1960s. New norms and replication of existing properties allow researchers to de-termine the continuing validity of norms collected years and in some cases decades ago. This article reports two extensions of the PYM norms. Part 1 reports a marked expansion of the number of prop-erties available for the original 925 PYM items, and Part 2 reports an expansion of the number of items for which basic properties are available. We also provide re-sults of factor analyses for both extensions, with the analysis in Part 1 being particularly informative about interrelationships among a diverse collection of word properties."

These norms confound bigram frequency with word frequency because each instance (i.e., token) of a particular word in a corpus of running text increments the frequencies of the bigrams that it contains. In this article, the authors report a set of type-based bigram frequencies in which each word (i.e., type) contributes only once, thereby unconfounding bigram frequency from word frequency.

Kintsch (2001, 2002) with respect to LSA as a dynamic model of semantic representation; (2) a best-dimension reduction measure of the latent semantic space, selecting those dimensions that best contribute to improving the LSA assessment of summaries (Hu, Cai, Wiemer-Hastings, Graesser, {\&} McNamara, 2007); and (3) the Euclidean distance measure, used by Rehder et al. (1998), which incorporates at the same time vector length and the cosine measures. A total of 192 Spanish middle-grade students and 6 experts took part in this study. They read an expository text and produced a short summary. Results showed significantly higher reliability of LSA as a computerized assessment tool for expository text when it used a best-dimension algorithm rather than a standard LSA algorithm. The semantic common network algorithm also showed promising results."

One area that has shown particular progress is the study of child language development. Although it is now easy to lexically tag every word in a spoken language corpus, one still has to choose between numerous ambiguous forms, especially with languages such as French or English, where more than 70{\%} of words are ambiguous. Computational linguistics can now provide a fully automatic disambiguation of lexical tags. The tool presented here (POST) can tag and disambiguate a large text in a few seconds. This tool complements systems dealing with language transcription and suggests further theoretical developments in the assessment of the status of morphosyntax in spoken language corpora. The program currently works for French and English, but it can be easily adapted for use with other languages. The analysis and computation of a corpus produced by normal French children 2-4 years of age, as well as of a sample corpus produced by French SLI children, are given as examples."

In fact, neuroimaging studies have suggested that reading high- and low-imageable words elicits distinct neural activation patterns for the two types e.g., Bedny {\&} Thompson-Schill (Brain and Language 98:127-139, 2006; Graves, Binder, Desai, Conant, {\&} Seidenberg NeuroImage 53:638-646, 2010).

However, multilevel models can also be used when two random factors are crossed at the same level, rather than nested.

A comparison with previous norms showed that noun concepts are more multimodal than adjective concepts, as nouns tend to subsume multiple adjectival property concepts (e.g., perceptual experience of the concept baby involves auditory, haptic, olfactory, and visual properties, and hence leads to multimodal perceptual strength). To show the value of these norms, we then used them to test a prediction of the sound symbolism hypothesis: Analysis revealed a systematic relationship between strength of perceptual experience in the referent concept and surface word form, such that distinctive perceptual experience tends to attract distinctive lexical labels. In other words, modality-specific norms of perceptual strength are useful for exploring not just the nature of grounded concepts, but also the nature of form-meaning relationships.

Participants read sentences that implied a (typical or atypical) color for a target object and then performed a modified Stroop task in which they named the ink color of the target word (typical, atypical, or unrelated). Results showed that color naming was facilitated both when ink color was typical for that object (e.g., bear in brown ink) and when it matched the color implied by the previous sentence (e.g., bear in white ink following Joe was excited to see a bear at the North Pole).

We show that the degree of cross-linguistic overlap varies, such that words can be more or less “cognate,” in terms of their phonological and semantic overlap. Bilinguals also translated these words in both directions (L1–L2 and L2–L1), providing a measure of translation equivalency. Notably, we reveal for the first time that Japanese–English cognates are “special,” in the sense that they are usually translated using one English term (e.g., コール /kooru/ is always translated as “call”), but the English word is translated into a greater variety of Japanese words. This difference in translation equivalency likely extends to other nonetymologically related, different-script languages in which cognates are all loanwords (e.g., Korean–English). Norming data were also collected for L1 age of acquisition, L1 concreteness, and L2 familiarity, because such information had been unavailable for the item set.

However, despite the growing interest in the Chinese language, there are only a few sources of word frequency measures available to researchers, and the quality is less than what researchers in other languages are used to. Methodology Following recent work by New, Brysbaert, and colleagues in English, French and Dutch, we assembled a database of word and character frequencies based on a corpus of film and television subtitles (46.8 million characters, 33.5 million words). In line with what has been found in the other languages, the new word and character frequencies explain significantly more of the variance in Chinese word naming and lexical decision performance than measures based on written texts. Conclusions Our results confirm that word frequencies based on subtitles are a good estimate of daily language exposure and capture much of the variance in word processing efficiency. In addition, our database is the first to include information about the contextual diversity of the words and to provide good frequency estimates for multi-character words and the different syntactic roles in which the words are used.

We present modality exclusivity norms for 485 Dutch nouns rated on visual, auditory, haptic, gustatory, and olfactory associations. We found these nouns are highly multimodal. They were rated most dominant in vision, and least in olfaction. A factor analysis identified two main dimensions: one loaded strongly on olfaction and gustation (reflecting joint involvement in flavor), and a second loaded strongly on vision and touch (reflecting joint involvement in manipulable objects). In a second study, we validated the ratings with similarity judgments. As expected, words from the same dominant modality were rated more similar than words from different dominant modalities; but – more importantly – this effect was enhanced when word pairs had high modality strength ratings. We further demonstrated the utility of our ratings by investigating whether perceptual modalities are differentially experienced in space, in a third study. Nouns were categorized into their dominant modality and used in a lexical decision experiment where the spatial position of words was either in proximal or distal space. We found words dominant in olfaction were processed faster in proximal than distal space compared to the other modalities, suggesting olfactory information is mentally simulated as “close” to the body. Finally, we collected ratings of emotion (valence, dominance, and arousal) to assess its role in perceptual space simulation, but the valence did not explain the data. So, words are processed differently depending on their perceptual associations, and strength of association is captured by modality exclusivity ratings."

"Yee, Lydia T. S.",PLOS ONE,valence arousal familiarity concreteness and imageability ratings for 292 two character chinese nouns in cantonese speakers in hong kong,2017,"Words are frequently used as stimuli in cognitive psychology experiments, for example, in recognition memory studies. In these experiments, it is often desirable to control for the words' psycholinguistic properties because differences in such properties across experi-mental conditions might introduce undesirable confounds. In order to avoid confounds, stud-ies typically check to see if various affective and lexico-semantic properties are matched across experimental conditions, and so databases that contain values for these properties are needed. While word ratings for these variables exist in English and other European lan-guages, ratings for Chinese words are not comprehensive. In particular, while ratings for sin-gle characters exist, ratings for two-character words—which often have different meanings than their constituent characters, are scarce. In this study, ratings for 292 two-character Chi-nese nouns were obtained from Cantonese speakers in Hong Kong. Affective variables, including valence and arousal, and lexico-semantic variables, including familiarity, concrete-ness, and imageability, were rated in the study. The words were selected from a film subtitle database containing word frequency information that could be extracted and listed along-side the resulting ratings. Overall, the subjective ratings showed good reliability across all rated dimensions, as well as good reliability within and between the different groups of par-ticipants who each rated a subset of the words. Moreover, several well-established relation-ships between the variables found consistently in other languages were also observed in this study, demonstrating that the ratings are valid. The resulting word database can be used in studies where control for the above psycholinguistic variables is critical to the research design.

Research on the perceptual-cognitive mechanisms underlying the processing of natural emotional body language can benefit greatly from datasets of natural emotional body expressions that facilitate stimulus manipulation and analysis. The existing databases have so far focused on few emotion categories which display predominantly prototypical, exaggerated emotion expressions. Moreover, many of these databases consist of video recordings which limit the ability to manipulate and analyse the physical properties of these stimuli. We present a new database consisting of a large set (over 1400) of natural emotional body expressions typical of monologues. To achieve close-to-natural emotional body expressions, amateur actors were narrating coherent stories while their body movements were recorded with motion capture technology. The resulting 3-dimensional motion data recorded at a high frame rate (120 frames per second) provides fine-grained information about body movements and allows the manipulation of movement on a body joint basis. For each expression it gives the positions and orientations in space of 23 body joints for every frame. We report the results of physical motion properties analysis and of an emotion categorisation study. The reactions of observers from the emotion categorisation study are included in the database. Moreover, we recorded the intended emotion expression for each motion sequence from the actor to allow for investigations regarding the link between intended and perceived emotions. The motion sequences along with the accompanying information are made available in a searchable MPI Emotional Body Expression Database.

The purpose of the present study was to construct norms for positive and negative emotion and emotion-laden words and their color associations. Participants were asked to provide the first color that came to mind for a set of 160 emotional items. The results revealed that the color RED was most commonly associated with negative emotion and emotion-laden words, whereas YELLOW and WHITE were associated with positive emotion and emotion-laden words, respectively. The present work provides researchers with a large database to aid in stimulus construction and selection."

In this work, we present the Minho Word Pool (MWP), a dataset that provides normative values of imageability, concreteness, and subjective frequency for 3,800 (European) Portuguese words-three subjective measures that, in spite of being used extensively in research, have been scarce for Portuguese.

Here we present a set of norms for valence and arousal for a very large set of Spanish words, including items from a variety of frequencies, semantic categories, and parts of speech, including a subset of conjugated verbs. In this regard, we found that there were significant but very small differences between the ratings for conjugations of the same verb, validating the practice of applying the ratings for infinitives to all derived forms of the verb.

The results revealed that 71{\%} of the English words received more than one correct translation indicating the large amount of translation ambiguity when translating from English to Chinese. The relationship between translation ambiguity and word frequency, concreteness and language proficiency was investigated. Although the significant correlations were not strong, results revealed that English word frequency was positively correlated with the number of alternative translations, whereas English word concreteness was negatively correlated with the number of translations. Importantly, regression analyses showed that the number of Chinese translations was predicted by word frequency and concreteness. Furthermore, an interaction between these predictors revealed that the number of translations was more affected by word frequency for more concrete words than for less concrete words. In addition, mixed-effects modelling showed that word frequency, concreteness and English language proficiency were all significant predictors of whether or not a dominant translation was provided. Finally, correlations between the word frequencies of English words and their Chinese dominant translations were higher for translation-unambiguous pairs than for translation-ambiguous pairs. The translation norms are made available in a database together with lexical information about the words, which will be a useful resource for researchers investigating Chinese-English bilingual language processing."

For all the languages, word frequency and goodness of depiction had large effects, but objective picture complexity did not. Effects of word structure variables (length, syllable structure, compounding, and initial frication) varied markedly over languages. Strong cross-language correlations were found in naming latencies, frequency, and length. Other-language frequency effects were observed (e.g., Chinese frequencies predicting Spanish reaction times) even after within-language effects were controlled (e.g., Spanish frequencies predicting Spanish reaction times).

The time taken to read acronyms aloud was also recorded. Correlational analyses indicated that the relations between the psycholinguistic variables were similar to those usually found for common words (e.g., highly imageable acronyms were more frequent and learned earlier in life than less imageable acronyms), but were generally weaker in the former than in the latter. Linear mixed-model analyses performed on the reading latencies revealed that the main determinants were the voicing feature of initial phonemes, the type of pronunciation of the acronyms (ambiguous vs. unambiguous, typical vs. atypical characteristics), length (number of letters and number of syllables), together with bigram frequency, printed frequency, and imageability. Both objective frequency and imageability interacted reliably with the ambiguous typical and ambiguous atypical properties. Accuracy was predicted by the number of letters and by imageability factors: More errors occurred on longer than on shorter acronyms, and also more errors on less imageable than on more imageable acronyms. The theoretical and methodological implications of the findings for the understanding of acronym reading are discussed.

We report herein imageability ratings and rating response times (RTs) for 1,197 words previously categorized as pure nouns, pure verbs, or words of balanced noun-verb usage on the basis of the Francis and Kucera (1982) norms. Nouns and verbs differed in rated imageability, and there was a stronger correspondence between imageability rating and RT for nouns than for verbs. For all word types, the image-rating-RT function implied that subjects employed an image generation process to assign ratings. We also report a new measure of noun-verb typicality that used the Hyperspace Analog to Language (HAL; Lund {\&} Burgess, 1996) context vectors (derived from a large sample of Usenet text) to compute the mean context distance between each word and all of the pure nouns and pure verbs. For a subset of the items, the resulting HAL noun-verb difference score was compared with part-of-speech usage in a representative sample of the Usenet corpus. It is concluded that this score can be used to estimate the extent to which a given word occurs in typical noun or verb sentence contexts in informal contemporary English discourse.

Research in word processing has used acronyms as a tool to answer fundamental questions such as the nature of the word superiority effect (WSE) or which is the best way to account for word-reading processes. In this study, acronym naming was assessed by looking at the influence that a number of variables known to affect mainstream word processing has had in acronym naming. The nature of the effect of these factors on acronym naming was examined using a multilevel regression analysis. First, 146 acronyms were described in terms of their age of acquisition, bigram and trigram frequencies, imageability, number of orthographic neighbors, frequency, orthographic and phonological length, print-to-pronunciation patterns, and voicing characteristics. Naming times were influenced by lexical and sublexical factors, indicating that acronym naming is a complex process affected by more variables than those previously considered."

In an experiment with adult learners, target words were presented in six different sentence contexts, and the number of informative versus misleading contexts was systematically manipulated. Participants generated a target definition after each sentence, and the definition-scoring algorithm was used to assess the degree of accuracy on each trial. We observed incremental improvements in definition accuracy across trials. Moreover, learning curves were sensitive to the proportion of misleading contexts, the use of spaced versus massed practice, and individual differences, demonstrating the utility of this procedure for capturing specific experimental effects on the trajectory of word learning.

To date, the vast majority of sentence processing research involving verb bias has been conducted almost exclusively with monolingual speakers, and predominantly with monolingual English speakers, despite the fact that most of the world's population is bilingual. To test the generality of competing theories of sentence comprehension, it is important to conduct cross-linguistic studies of sentence processing and to add bilingual data to theories of sentence comprehension. Given this, it is critical for the field to develop verb bias estimates from monolingual speakers of languages other than English and from bilingual populations. We begin to address these issues in two norming studies. Study 1 provides verb bias norming data for 135 Spanish verbs. A second aim of Study 1 was to determine whether verb bias estimates remain stable over time. In Study 2, we asked whether Spanish-English speakers are able to learn verb-specific information, such as verb bias, in their second language. The answer to this question is critical to conducting studies that examine when, during the course of sentence comprehension, bilingual speakers exploit verb information specific to the second language. To facilitate cross-linguistic work, we compared our verb bias results with those provided by monolingual English speakers in a previous norming study conducted by Garnsey, Lotocky, Pearlmutter, and Myers (1997). Our Spanish data demonstrated that individual verbs showed significant similarities in their verb bias across the 3 years of data collection.

A feed-forward neural network is trained using back propagation to provide a mapping from co-occurrence vectors to feature norms collected from subjects.

Several approaches have been introduced for detecting plagiarism in the text documents based on the syntactic structure of the text, string similarity, fingerprinting, semantic meaning underlying the text, etc. The basic limitation of plagiarism detection systems these days is that they fail to detect tough cases of plagiarism. The proposed plagiarism detection approach is the hybrid of semantic and syntactic similarity between the text documents. This novel approach exploits linguistic information sources non-linearly using the lexical database for finding the relatedness between text documents. The proposed approach uses semantic knowledge to perform cognitive-inspired computing. The framework is capable of detecting intelligent plagiarism cases like a verbatim copy, paraphrasing, rewording in a sentence, and sentence transformation.

"Caselli, Naomi K.",NA,language deprivation and the american sign language lexicon,2016,"Our understanding of the mental lexicon, the way meaning is extracted from word forms, is almost entirely built on data from spoken languages. While there is much work demonstrating that in many ways the linguistic structure and psychological mechanisms for processing signed language and spoken language processing are the same, less is known about the signed language mental lexicon. In this dissertation, I examine the structure of the American Sign Language mental lexicon, and the ways meaning can be extracted from the manual/visual signal. In the third chapter of this dissertation I ask whether a single cognitive architecture might explain diverse behavioral patterns in signed and spoken language. Chen and Mirman (2012) presented a computational model of word processing that unified opposite effects of neighborhood density in speech production, perception, and written word recognition. Carreiras et al. (2008) demonstrate that neighborhood density effects in Spanish Sign Language (LSE) also vary depending on whether the neighbors share the same handshape or location. We present a spreading activation architecture that borrows the principles proposed by Chen and Mirman (2012), and show that if this architecture is elaborated to incorporate relatively minor facts about either 1) the time course of sign perception or 2) the frequency of sub-lexical units in sign languages, it produces data that match the experimental findings from sign languages. This work serves as a proof of concept that a single cognitive architecture could underlie both sign and word recognition. In the second chapter I present ASL-LEX, a lexical database for ASL that catalogues more than forty properties about almost 1,000 signs. The database includes, for example, information about each sign's iconicity, phonological make-up, and neighborhood density. I use this information to better understand the structure of the ASL lexicon, the distribution of each of these properties, and the relationships between these properties. This lexical database is the largest and most comprehensive database of ASL, and can be used by researchers to develop experiments and by educators to identify and support vocabulary development. In the fourth chapter, I use ASL-LEX to develop a tightly-controlled study of sign perception. I ask whether neighborhood density and sub-lexical frequency play a role in sign perception, and if the mechanisms of sign perception are affected by early language experience. Eighty deaf participants with varying early language backgrounds completed a lexical decision task. I find that neighborhood density inhibits sign perception in people with low early ASL exposure, but has no effect in people with high early ASL exposure. Location frequency inhibits sign perception in all people, but the effect is stronger in people with low early ASL exposure. This suggests that impoverished access to ASL early in life has lasting consequences for sign perception. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"

Sign repetition latencies and accuracy were obtained when native signers were asked to reproduce a sign displayed on a computer screen. Results indicated that, as predicted, phonological similarity facilitated repetition latencies and accuracy as long as there were no strict constraints on the type of sublexical features that overlapped. The data converged to suggest that one similarity measure, MaxD, defined as the overlap of any 4 sublexical features, likely best represents mechanisms of phonological similarity in the mental lexicon. Together, these data suggest that lexical access in sign language is facilitated by phonologically similar lexical representations in memory and the optimal operationalization is defined as liberal constraints on overlap of 4 out of 5 sublexical features—similar to the majority of extant definitions in the literature.

"Eom, Soojeong",NA,automatic presentation of sense specific lexical information in an intelligent learning system,2013,"Learning vocabulary and understanding texts present difficulty for language learners due to, among other things, the high degree of lexical ambiguity. By developing an intelligent tutoring system, this dissertation examines whether automatically providing enriched sense-specific information is effective for vocabulary learning and reading comprehension of second language learners. The system developed in this study contributes to an extended understanding of how NLP techniques can be applied more effectively in an educational environment. The system allows learners to upload texts and click on any content word in order to obtain sense-appropriate lexical information for unfamiliar or unknown words during reading. The system consists of three components: (1) the system manager controls the interaction among each learner, the NLP server, and the lexical database; (2) the NLP server converts a raw input text to a linguistically-analyzed text; (3) the lexical database is used to provide a sense-appropriate definition and example sentences of a word to the learner. To obtain the sense-appropriate information, the system first performs word sense disambiguation (WSD) on the input text. Pointing to appropriate examples tuned for language learners, however, is complicated by the fact that the database of examples is from one repository (COBUILD), while automatic WSD systems generally rely on senses from another (WordNet). The lexical database, then, is indexed by WordNet senses, each of which points to an appropriate corresponding COBUILD sense. The fact that every sense inventory has its own standards of sense distinction poses a serious problem in integrating these inventories into one. To redirect an input WordNet sense to a corresponding COBUILD sense, thus, a word sense alignment algorithm was developed, following a heuristic of favoring flatter alignment structures. With this system, an empirical study was conducted with 60 intermediate learners of English as a second language to examine whether this system can lead learners to improve their vocabulary acquisition and reading comprehension. The findings show that learners demonstrated higher performance when receiving sense-specific information. Furthermore, the qualitative examination of the effect of automatic system errors show that, although learners showed learning regardless of the appropriateness of lexical information, they still showed relatively greater learning when given appropriate lexical information.

The Norwegian Communicative Development Inventories (CDI) norms were used to calculate each CDI word’s age of acquisition and vocabulary size of acquisition. Lexical properties were downloaded from the lexical database Norwegian Words, supplemented with data on frequency in adult and child-directed speech. Age of acquisition correlated highly with vocabulary size of acquisition, but the new measure was more evenly distributed and more sensitive to lexical effects. Frequency in child-directed speech was the most important predictor of lexical development, followed by imageability, which seems to account for the dominance of nominals over predicates in Norwegian.

The PolyOrth project was based on the assumption that the underlying, lexical phonological forms could be used to derive the surface orthographic forms by means of a combination of phoneme-grapheme mappings and sets of autonomous spelling rules for each language. One of the complications encountered during the project was the fact that the phonological forms in CELEX were not always genuinely underlying forms which made deriving the orthographic forms tricky.

This question is pursued by using a large lexical database to establish systematic correlations between spelling, phonology and morphology. The main insights are: Consonant doubling is most regular at morpheme boundaries. It can be described in graphemic terms alone, i.e. without reference to phonology. In monomorphemic words, consonant doubling depends mostly on the word ending. Certain endings correlate with double consonants (e.g. <er> as in <summer>), while others correlate with single consonants (e.g. <it> as in <visit>). What is more, it is the graphemic form of the word ending that determines the presence or absence of double consonants: The word endings <-ic> and <-ick>, for example, are homophonous, but the former almost always occurs with single consonants (e.g. <panic>), the latter with double consonants (e.g. <derrick>). That makes graphemic word endings peculiar entities: Like suffixes, they are recurring and they have distributional properties—but unlike suffixes, they have no morphosyntactic or semantic function.

Here, we developed a French version of the Connectionist Dual Process Model of Reading Aloud (CDP++) that can handle multisyllabic stimuli (up to three syllables) and has a large-scale lexicon of more than 100,000 words. We tested the model on extant data and an additional experiment examining the reading aloud of nonwords with potentially silent letters.

The results of the silent-letter experiment showed that, contrary to what would be predicted on the basis of lexical database statistics, people generally pronounce 'silent' consonants in nonwords.

In addition to the semantic verbal fluency test score, several other performance characteristics sensitive to disease status and predictive of future cognitive decline have been defined in terms of words generated from semantically related categories (clustering) and shifting between categories (switching). However, the traditional assessment of clustering and switching has been performed manually in a qualitative fashion resulting in subjective scoring with limited reproducibility and scalability. Our approach uses word definitions and hierarchical relations between the words in WordNet®, a large electronic lexical database, to quantify the degree of semantic similarity and relatedness between words.

As a matter of fact, the fine granularity of the WordNet sense inventory [Fellbaum, Christiane (ed.). 1998. WordNet: An Electronic Lexical Database MIT Press], a de facto standard within the research community, is one of the main causes of a low inter-tagger agreement ranging between 70% and 80% and the disappointing performance of automated fine-grained disambiguation systems (around 65% state of the art in the Senseval-3 English all-words task). In order to improve the performance of both manual and automated sense taggers, either we change the sense inventory (e.g. adopting a new dictionary or clustering WordNet senses) or we aim at resolving the disagreements between annotators by dealing with the fineness of sense distinctions. The former approach is not viable in the short term, as wide-coverage resources are not publicly available and no large-scale reliable clustering of WordNet senses has been released to date. The latter approach requires the ability to distinguish between subtle or misleading sense distinctions. In this paper, we propose the use of structural semantic interconnections—a specific kind of lexical chains—for the adjudication of disagreed sense assignments to words in context. The approach relies on the exploitation of the lexicon structure as a support to smooth possible divergencies between sense annotators and foster coherent choices. We perform a twofold experimental evaluation of the approach applied to manual annotations from the SemCor corpus, and automatic annotations from the Senseval-3 English all-words competition.

Traditional collaborative approaches compute a similarity value between the current user and each other user by taking into account their rating style, that is the set of ratings given on the same items. Based on the ratings of the most similar users, commonly referred to as neighbors, collaborative algorithms compute recommendations for the current user. The problem with this approach is that the similarity value is only computable if users have common rated items. The main contribution of this work is a possible solution to overcome this limitation. We propose a new content-collaborative hybrid recommender which computes similarities between users relying on their content-based profiles, in which user preferences are stored, instead of comparing their rating styles. In more detail, user profiles are clustered to discover current user neighbors. Content-based user profiles play a key role in the proposed hybrid recommender. Traditional keyword-based approaches to user profiling are unable to capture the semantics of user interests. A distinctive feature of our work is the integration of linguistic knowledge in the process of learning semantic user profiles representing user interests in a more effective way, compared to classical keyword-based profiles, due to a sense-based indexing. Semantic profiles are obtained by integrating machine learning algorithms for text categorization, namely a naïve Bayes approach and a relevance feedback method, with a word sense disambiguation strategy based exclusively on the lexical knowledge stored in the WordNet lexical database.

We present experimental results with artificial learners that show a competition effect between the two principles: adhering more to one principle leads to more violations of the other. The artificial learners, memory-based learning algorithms, are trained (1) to convert written words to their phonemic counterparts and (2) to analyze written words on their morphological composition, based on data extracted from the CELEX lexical database. As an exception to the competition effect we show that introducing the schwa as a letter in the spelling system causes both morphology and phonology to be learnt better by the artificial learners. In general we argue that artificial learning studies are a tool in obtaining objective measurements on a spelling system that may be of help in spelling reform processes.

The data confirm the existence of formationally related noun–verb pairs in Auslan in which the verb displays a single movement and the noun displays a repeated movement. The data also suggest that the best exemplars of noun–verb pairs of this type in Auslan form a distinct set of iconic (mimetic) signs archetypically based on inherently reversible actions (such as opening and shutting). This strong iconic link perhaps explains why the derivational process appears to be of limited productivity, though it does appear to have 'spread' to a number of signs that appear to have no such iconicity. There appears to be considerable variability in the use of the derivational markings, particularly in connected discourse, even for signs of the 'open and shut' variety. Overall, the derivational process is apparently still closely linked to an iconic base, is incipient in the grammar of Auslan, and is best described as only partially grammaticalized.

Various aspects of pitch movements throughout the words are systematically varied in order to determine what aspects of the pitch contour affect categorization of words on the basis of accent. In addition, this thesis also investigates the effect on categorization of loss of pitch due to lack of voicing in various parts of the word. The model determined by these studies reveals two more-or-less orthogonal perceptual dimensions; pitch alignment with speech segments determines accent location and the amount of pitch drop determines accent presence. This study also investigates how to quantify the distinctive function of pitch accent in a way which incorporates the frequency of the contrasting items, as well as the peculiar category structure of accents. This model was applied in the analysis of a large-scale lexical database, revealing many irregularities in the distribution and use of accents.

Aphasiological studies, linguistic theories and psycholinguistic studies suggest that their processing is operated at different stages in speech production. Models of sentence production propose that at the formulation stage, lexical words are processed at the functional level while grammatical words are processed at a later positional level. In this study we consider proposals made by linguistic theories and psycholinguistic models to derive two predictions for the processing of grammatical words compared to lexical words. First, based on the assumption that grammatical words are less crucial for communication and therefore paid less attention to, it is predicted that they show shorter articulation times and/or higher error rates than lexical words.

These results indicate that phonological systematicity at the prosodic level might play an important role in demarcating an iconic class of words. This cross-linguistic tendency towards high t)"

This paper proposes a dependency-based candidate boundary selection method (DCBS), which selects the most likely tokens as candidate boundaries and removes the exceptional tokens which have less potential to improve the performance based on dependency tree.

In this study we investigated whether semantic processing modes can also affect lexical-semantic activation during word production. Specifically, we tested whether the processing of linguistic ambiguities, presented in the form of puns, has an influence on the co-activation of unrelated meanings of homophones in a subsequent language production task. In a picture-word interference paradigm with word distractors that were semantically related or unrelated to the non-depicted meanings of homophones we found facilitation induced by related words only when participants listened to puns before object naming, but not when they heard jokes with unambiguous linguistic stimuli. This finding suggests that a semantic processing mode of ambiguity perception can induce the co-activation of alternative homophone meanings during speech planning. [ABSTRACT FROM )"

This may be due to the grouping of tones according to harmonic relationships by recognition mechanisms prior to fine pitch processing. Poorer frequency resolution of auditory information available to recognition mechanisms may lead to unrelated tones being grouped, resulting in underestimation of pitch number. Methods, Results and Conclusion: We tested whether pitch enumeration is better for chords of full harmonic complex tones, where grouping errors are less likely, than for complexes with fewer and less accurately tuned harmonics. Chords of low familiarity were used to mitigate the possibility that participants would recognize the chord itself and simply recall the number of pitches.

We propose a simple evolutionary model able to capture all of the observed behaviors, and we show that it reproduces quantitatively the empirical data.

At the same time, eye fixations were recorded using an eye-tracking device. The effect of linguistic complexity on language processing time was assessed from eye fixation information by systematically varying linguistic complexity. This was achieved with a sentence corpus containing seven German sentence structures.

Euphemisms are effective because they replace the trigger (the offending word form) by another word form that expresses a similar idea.

Recently, probabilistic models of language learning have been applied to this problem, framing it as a statistical inference from a random sample of sentences. These probabilistic models predict that learners should be sensitive to the way in which sentences are sampled. There are two main types of sampling assumptions that can operate in language learning: strong and weak sampling. Strong sampling, as assumed by probabilistic models, assumes the learning input is drawn from a distribution of grammatical samples from the underlying language and aims to learn this distribution. Thus, under strong sampling, the absence of a sentence construction from the input provides evidence that it has low or zero probability of grammaticality.

Twenty-three Japanese native speakers participated in this study. They read semantically reversible and non-reversible sentences with canonical word order, and those with scrambled word order. In our results, the second argument position in reversible sentences took longer to read than that in non-reversible sentences, indicating that animacy information is used in second argument processing.

Participants viewed a pair of briefly flashed objects and were then tested on either the relative spatial relation or identity of one of those objects.

In this model, linguistic terms represented as triangular fuzzy numbers are used to quantify experts’ uncertain assessments of alternatives with respect to the criteria. The fuzzy set is then integrated into the AHP to determine the weights of the criteria. Finally, a fuzzy ARAS is used to calculate the weights of the alternatives.

We propose that this bidirectional link between motor system and language arises because the motor system implements forward models that predict the sensory consequences of actions. Because the same movement (e.g., raising the arm) can have multiple forward models for different contexts, the models can make different predictions depending on whether the arm is raised, for example, to place an object or raised as a threat.

Both predictions were corroborated by two experiments in which observers judged the perceived slant of a random-dot planar surface during egomotion.

The study focused on the use of non-agentive syntax to encode mistakes in Spanish ('The vase was broken') versus using agentive syntax in English ('She broke the vase') influences event fairness perceptions. We hypothesized that when justice violations are encoded using Spanish, because the non-agentive syntax makes the responsible party less salient, the event would be perceived as less unfair. In Study 1 (n = 111), English-speaking participants rated the fairness of an event in which a mistake was made and an employee received a negative outcome. They rated it as more unfair (p < .01, η² = .06) when the scenario was presented in agentive syntax. Experiment 2 (n = 70) used native English- and Spanish-speakers who watched a video of manager making a mistake. We found that Spanish-speakers used less agentive syntax (p < .01, η² = .21), perceived the event as less unfair (p < .001, η² = .23), and were more willing to help the manager who made the mistake. In Experiment 3 (n = 101) we replicated this effect controlling for cross-cultural differences and native language; further, we found an interaction between entity fairness (event vs. entity) and native language (Spanish vs. English) on citizenship intentions (p < .01, η² = .08).

As morning circles are turned into language teaching lessons on a regular basis, we describe the linguistic features that emerge as learning objects, and some of the learning practices in which they are embedded.

The asymmetry effect is magnified by discrepancies in prominence between subject and reference, and has previously been explained using A. Tversky's (1977) feature-matching model. Given a linguistic norm to place more prominent objects in the referent position, violation of this norm might reduce sentence clarity, which then weakens the magnitude of subsequent relational judgments. 53 undergraduates completed a study that tested the degree to which both clarity and feature-matching predicted the magnitude of relational judgments by construction in 3 regression models, on for each of the 3 types of relation statements: similarity, difference, and spatial relation. Clarity perceptions predict the magnitude of relational judgments independently of the cognitive manipulation of the features of the compared objects. The pattern of findings suggests that a linguistic norm interpretation may account for variance in relational judgments independently of Tversky's feature-matching model.

This research focuses on the differential use of Spanish and Portuguese in Rivera, the largest city on the border. Using self-reported data and metalinguistic commentaries extracted from interviews with 63 Spanish–Portuguese bilinguals, the use of both languages in various domains (home, school, work spaces) and with diverse interlocutors (family, friends, co-workers, superiors) is analyzed. Quantitative and qualitative analysis reveals that Portuguese, which has been marginalized for decades, is more frequently used in the home with relatives and close friends. The use of Portuguese in more formal domains, including schools, is much less frequent. The results from this study corroborate a perception within the community that Portuguese lacks the prestige of Spanish and provide further evidence of its status as a primarily home language. The current research does not show a progressive shift toward Spanish in Rivera nor does it support claims by other researchers that this community is diglossic.

The report of an empirical study shows that the current LMS design does not provide writing students in general and writing students from periphery cultural and linguistic backgrounds in particular an opportunity of a higher-level interactivity with the LMS. The current design neither includes periphery students' cultural and linguistic norms and values, nor does it allow them to affect the existing design through their design activities. These LMSs are currently constraining users from higher-level interactions. As a result, writing students have to act as the LMS ask them to do, and they remain passive in these platforms.

We examined variables derived from eco-dialogical coding of an episode of World of Warcraft play involving three English learners. According to the Eco-dialogical model (Zheng, 2012), second language (L2) learners need to learn to take skilled linguistic action (Cowley, 2013), a process of realizing the values of physical, sociocultural and dialogical affordances in the environment. We employed Multinomial Logistic Regression to determine which of our variables were predictors for three types of values realizing; namely, wayfinding orienting to sociocultural norms and synergized values realizing of both wayfinding and orientation to sociocultural norms. The model we developed suggested that when communicative projects collectively entailed players’ a) verbalizing with synchronized avatar action, b) attending to game rules and c) coordinating in anticipation of good future prospects, players were more likely to realize both values realizing types synergistically. In other words, players' skilled linguistic action of prospective coordination, combined with multimodal languaging and constrained by WoW game rules, together, were more likely to lead to dual values realizing. This finding suggests that dual values realizing evokes connections between real-time first-order physical movements and multimodal languaging with situation transcending practices (Linell, 2009) which are second-order rules, and other sociocultural and linguistic norms. Coupling this finding with our Eco-dialogical unit of analysis, communicative projects, we suggest that these language learners developed co-agency. We conclude that our model should be tested in future studies that seek to illuminate the contribution of a new Eco-dialogical understanding of L2 learning and the potential for learners to have high quality languaging experiences in multiplayer 3D game environments and other social semiotically rich contexts.

The rebellious and playful identities of the boys in this study are at times in conflict with their desire to be productive and high-achieving. In this study of an English Mother Tongue classroom in a German-American bilingual school in Berlin, Germany, five boys are faced with this dilemma. One tactic used by some of the boys to resolve the conflict is the use of Mock NSE. The use of Mock NSE by these boys is a salient socio-pragmatic device for indicating how they wish to be identified.

Rather than considering it exclusively a language issue, we claim that language is an index of a process of constructing the school as 'different' and the school body as non-academic. In the analysis of discourses and practices, social class emerges as one of the grounding motivations for such 'difference', which leads to low academic demands, a life skills educational perspective, and lack of competence in Catalan, with serious consequences for students’ social access.

Language is conceptualized as a collective invention, on the model of writing or the wheel, and the book places social and cultural dynamics at the centre of its evolution: language emerged and further developed in human communities already suffused with meaning and communication, mimesis, ritual, song and dance, coparenting, new divisions of labour, and revolutionary changes in social relations. The book thus challenges assumptions about the causal relations between genes, capacities, social communication, and innovation: the biological capacities are taken to evolve incrementally on the basis of cognitive plasticity, in a process that recruits previous adaptations and fine-tunes them to serve novel communicative ends. Topics include the ability brought about by language to tell lies, which must have confronted our ancestors with new problems of public trust; the dynamics of social-cognitive co-evolution; the role of gesture and mimesis in linguistic communication; studies of how monkeys and apes express their feelings or thoughts; play, laughter, dance, song, ritual, and other social displays among extant hunter-gatherers; the social nature of language acquisition and innovation; normativity and the emergence of linguistic norms; the interaction of language and emotions; and novel perspectives on the timeframe for language evolution.

"Leonard, Stephen Pax",Language in Society,relative linguistic homogeneity in a new society the case of iceland,2011,"The language of a speech community can only act as an identity marker for all of its speakers if linguistic norms are widely shared and if a minimal number of language varieties are spoken. This article examines briefly how a linguistic norm came to serve the whole of Iceland and how a situation of relative linguistic homogeneity was maintained for centuries. Sociolinguistic theory tells us that the speech community that we can reconstruct for early Iceland should lead to the establishment and maintenance of local norms. However, Iceland, arguably monodialectal, was certainly characterized by long-term linguistic homogeneity and remained a society where nucleated settlements barely formed over a thousand-year period. Scholars have argued that a mixture of dialects leveled shortly after the settlement of Iceland in the ninth century (Settlement). Studies show that dialect leveling requires dialect mixing, the convergence of people on one place, and sustained linguistic contact between the speakers. The settlement pattern of Iceland is indicative of population divergence (not convergence) and there is limited evidence of sustained contact. It is therefore proposed that the dialect leveling might be linked instead with significant population movements and social upheaval in mainland Scandinavia in the immediate pre-Viking period. The variety of Norse that was taken westward across the Atlantic might itself already have been the result of several earlier stages of mixing and koineization. It is only by combining linguistic, historical, and archaeological knowledge that this problem of how one linguistic norm came to serve the whole of Iceland can be understood.

Teachers’ classroom narratives presented theories of affective accommodation and affective display, where respect for a teacher’s feelings was supposed to be given priority over respect for a child’s feelings, but children did not always comply with these theories. By illustrating how teachers’ metapragmatic ideologies about children’s identities as Korean Americans, contexts of language acquisition, and linguistic needs mediate the interactional construction of (dis)respect, this paper demonstrates the hybrid/multidirectional nature of language socialization.

"Schnurr, Stephanie",Journal of Pragmatics,constructing leader identities through teasing at work,2009,"Workplaces constitute important sites where individuals construct and negotiate their various social identities. And one of the most crucial sites where this identity construction takes place is in working groups (which often form communities of practice). Over time, these groups may develop a shared repertoire of linguistic norms on which members regularly draw when interacting with each other. Drawing on over 40 h of authentic discourse data, this paper illustrates how three leaders construct their professional identities by using teasing humour in ways that exploit the specific discursive norms that characterise their respective working groups. Teasing comprises a valuable component of the linguistic repertoire negotiated among group members. This discourse strategy not only constitutes a prime means for identity construction but also assists the leaders in achieving their various workplace objectives. A comparison of the ways in which the leaders use teasing humour indicates substantial pragmatic differences in their choice of teasing style. These differences reflect, contribute to and reinforce the normative communicative behaviours which characterise the leaders’ working groups. By systematically drawing on the discursive style developed in their respective community of practice, the leaders 'do leadership' in ways that are considered appropriate and normative in their workplace.

"Tosone, Carol",Psychoanalytical Social Work,sotto voce internalized misogyny and the politics of gender in corporate america,2009,"Language can serve as a potent and injurious tool against ambitious women in the workplace. Consider how often both men and women have thought or said 'bitch' or other derogatory terms when describing a woman in a leadership position. Freud once described mental health as the ability to love and to work. For many of these women, their work has also become their love, their passion. Working long hours, often working 'twice as hard as men,' to be viewed as equally competent, perhaps sacrificing spouse and children in deference to career, these women have been inculcated into a patriarchal corporate environment, one in which they must act in a sexual dissonant manner in order to succeed. And as they negotiate the male managerial model, they often come to view their own femininity in an objectified, disparaging way. They may defeminize their language and adopt a 'more adversarial, information-focused style characteristic of all male talk'. Here is where the dilemma begins: If they conform to the masculine linguistic norms of the corporate environment, then their behavior can be perceived as confrontational, harsh, contentious, un-lady-like. A collision of culture ensues on intrapsychic and interpersonal levels between what is expected of a woman in society and what is expected of a person in a high status position where valued leadership traits are male-gendered. Often these women select language and styles that veer away from the feminine side of the gender spectrum. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)"

Though computers are often blamed for a perceived deterioration of culture and language, Baron notes that scorn and mistrust of communication technologies is not a new phenomenon; in fact, writing, the printing press, and the telegraph were all greeted at first with skepticism. And despite the pervasive anxiety that 'internet speech' is resulting in the destruction of grammar and spelling, Baron observes that online communities enforce their own linguistic norms. Rather than a linguistic free-for-all, Baron argues, 'spelling counts' in virtual spaces just as it does offline.

While consideration of this issue has begun in the work of authors he cites in his review, and elsewhere, it is, as Leung points out, a multiply complex issue, in which the social dimension is the crux of the problem, ‘in terms of speaker subject positions, lexicogrammatical norms, transcultural pragmatic conventions and so on’. It is clear that language testing—particularly significant here as a site of authority about linguistic norms, not unlike a dictionary—has an important role to play in authorizing or de-authorizing English as a lingua franca communication as a proper target for language learning; a further demonstration, if one were needed, of the power of tests. But beyond this political and institutional dimension, the psychometric problems inherent in designing tests based on a construct that is local, situated, and fluid pose a difficult but productive challenge to testers.

This chapter will start by providing a brief background description of the linguistic characteristics of slang and swearing before moving to a more focused discussion of why (although such language is also commonly used by many adult groups who find themselves living in close proximity in institutionalized contexts such as prisons or military camps), it may be particularly typical of adolescent speech. Subsequent sections of the chapter explore how the use of slang and expletives by young people can be viewed as a means of building cultural capital within their networks, while at the same time establishing boundaries between new adolescent in-groups ('us') and parents and nonmembers ('them'). A section on the use of pejorative terms further develops this theme of 'us' and 'them.' In addition, I also consider gender-based patterns of the ways young people use slang and expletives, and the subtle coercive effect such words have in regulating typical patterns of in-group behavior.

"Swagman, Kirstin J.",NA,language names and norms in bosnia and herzegovina,2012,"The institutionalization of separate standard varieties for Bosnian, Croatian, and Serbian in the 1990s was hailed by many Bosnians as the long-denied recognition of the Bosnian idiom as distinct from the Serbian and Croatian varieties it had so often been subordinated under. Yet the accompanying codification of Bosnian standard language forms has been highly controversial in Bosnia, and debates continue today about how to define the Bosnian language My dissertation explores the paradox that while many Bosnians support the Bosnian language as a name, they often do not support it as a norm . To explore this paradox, I undertook 12 months of fieldwork in four different middle schools in Bosnia. Education is a domain in which linguistic norms are highlighted. In Bosnia, it is also an area in which language variation is deemed to be particularly problematic by observers, participants, and commentators both locally and abroad. The decentralized nature of education in Bosnia means that classrooms are often ethnically segregated and curricula in use across the country are not harmonized. Language standardization has often been analyzed as a state-sponsored process that works through official institutions to reduce heterogeneity and promote uniform understandings of linguistic forms and their semiotic meanings. This dissertation explores ongoing language standardization campaigns in Bosnia and Herzegovina and argues that traditional ways of understanding the role of institutions in language standardization don't explain why standardization has been so unsuccessful in the post-war Bosnian state. My research challenges the idea that institutions must be engaged in drawing rigid us/them boundaries to be thought of as representative or legitimate, instead pointing to the possibility that ambiguity can be a marker of legitimacy rather than a threat to it. This dissertation explores how ideologies of heterogeneity and free choice in language work against the imposition of a standard norm at the same time as European aspirations and ideas about post-socialist normalcy push many Bosnians to believe their country should have such a standard. The resulting tension is the space in which choice between standard variants takes on social meaning and contributes to emerging definitions of what it means to be Bosnian.

Some of these uniformities are linguistic norms; others of a more psychological nature are related to conditions under which speech responses occur. The linguistic response-type is defined as any uniformity in speech behavior which exhibits a certain behavioral structure. This common behavioral structure is characterized in some detail. Employing the qualifications listed, one can separate linguistic from nonlinguistic behavior. The former includes all speech behavior as well as many nonvocal gestures. Psychological properties of linguistic response-types are to be studied in terms of their strength. Thus verbal behavior 'is seen as a series of movements patterned in overlapping units. The uniformities underlying these movements exist as behavioral habits, or response-types, the strengths of which are subject to continual change.'

We describe the creation of a large data set of predictions from several smoothing algorithms about the acceptability of unseen grammatical phrases and a novel experimental method for the pairwise comparison of these models. We use this method to compare three smoothing methods and consider the results in light of the differences among the models.

The tool also includes a source overlap feature, which calculates lexical and semantic overlap between a source and a response text (i.e., cohesion between the two texts based measures of text relatedness). In the first study in this article, we examined the effects that cohesion features, prompt, essay elaboration, and enhanced cohesion had on expert ratings of text coherence, finding that global semantic similarity as reported by word2vec was an important predictor of coherence ratings. A second study was conducted to examine the source and response indices. In this study we examined whether source overlap between the speaking samples found in the TOEFL-iBT integrated speaking tasks and the responses produced by test-takers was predictive of human ratings of speaking proficiency. The results indicated that the percentage of keywords found in both the source and response and the similarity between the source document and the response, as reported by word2vec, were significant predictors of speaking quality. Combined, these findings help validate the new indices reported for TAACO 2.0."

Rather than each word of the sentence being presented in succession, two words are presented at the same time, and the participant must choose which word is a grammatical continuation of the sentence. This procedure forces the reader into an incremental mode of processing in which each word must be fully integrated with the preceding context before the next word can be considered. Previous research with this technique has not considered whether it is sufficiently sensitive to syntactic complexity effects or to garden path effects. Four experiments are reported demonstrating that reliable differences in processing time for subject relatives and object relatives can be obtained, and that this technique generates garden path effects that correspond closely with the data from eyetracking experiments, but without the spillover effects that are sometimes obtained with eyetracking. It is also shown that the task is sensitive to word frequency effects, producing estimates well in excess of those found with eyetracking."

Applying a recently proposed semantic theory of survey response, we claim that survey responses tap two different sources: a mixture of attitudes plus the semantic structure of the survey. Exploring the degree to which individual responses are influenced by semantics, we hypothesized that in many cases, information about attitude strength is actually filtered out as noise in the commonly used correlation matrix. We developed a procedure to separate the semantic influence from attitude strength in individual response patterns, and compared these results to, respectively, the observed sample correlation matrices and the semantic similarity structures arising from text analysis algorithms. This was done with four datasets, comprising a total of 7,787 subjects and 27,461,502 observed item pair responses. As we argued, attitude strength seemed to account for much information about the individual respondents. However, this information did not seem to carry over into the observed sample correlation matrices, which instead converged around the semantic structures offered by the survey items. This is potentially disturbing for the traditional understanding of what survey data represent. We argue that this approach contributes to a better understanding of the cognitive processes involved in survey responses. In turn, this could help us make better use of the data that such methods provide."

Gary LupyanRobert L. Goldstone,Behavior Research Methods,introduction to special issue beyond the lab using big data to discover principles of cognition,2019,"Like many other scientific disciplines, psychological science has felt the impact of the big-data revolution. This impact arises from the meeting of three forces: data availability, data heterogeneity, and data analyzability. In terms of data availability, consider that for decades, researchers relied on the Brown Corpus of about one million words (Kučera & Francis, 1969). Modern resources, in contrast, are larger by six orders of magnitude (e.g., Google’s 1T corpus) and are available in a growing number of languages. About 240 billion photos have been uploaded to Facebook,1 and Instagram receives over 100 million new photos each day.2 The large-scale digitization of these data has made it possible in principle to analyze and aggregate these resources on a previously unimagined scale. Heterogeneity refers to the availability of different types of data. For example, recent progress in automatic image recognition is owed not just to improvements in algorithms and hardware, but arguably more to the ability to merge large collections of images with linguistic labels (produced by crowdsourced human taggers) that serve as training data to the algorithms. Making use of heterogeneous data sources often depends on their standardization. For example, the ability to combine demographic and grammatical data about thousands of languages led to the finding that languages spoken by more people have simpler morphologies (Lupyan & Dale, 2010). The ability to combine these data types would have been substantially more difficult without the existence of standardized language and country codes that could be used to merge the different data sources. Finally, analyzability must be ensured, for without appropriate tools to process and analyze different types of data, the “data” are merely bytes."

The Glasgow Norms are unique in several respects. First, the corpus itself is relatively large, while simultaneously providing norms across a substantial number of lexical dimensions. Second, for any given subset of words, the same participants provided ratings across all nine dimensions (33 participants/word, on average). Third, two novel dimensions—semantic size and gender association—are included. Finally, the corpus contains a set of 379 ambiguous words that are presented either alone (e.g., toast) or with information that selects an alternative sense (e.g., toast (bread), toast (speech)). The relationships between the dimensions of the Glasgow Norms were initially investigated by assessing their correlations. In addition, a principal component analysis revealed four main factors, accounting for 82% of the variance (Visualization, Emotion, Salience, and Exposure). The validity of the Glasgow Norms was established via comparisons of our ratings to 18 different sets of current psycholinguistic norms. The dimension of size was tested with megastudy data, confirming findings from past studies that have explicitly examined this variable. Alternative senses of ambiguous words (i.e., disambiguated forms), when discordant on a given dimension, seemingly led to appropriately distinct ratings. Informal comparisons between the ratings of ambiguous words and of their alternative senses showed different patterns that likely depended on several factors (the number of senses, their relative strengths, and the rating scales themselves). Overall, the Glasgow Norms provide a valuable resource—in particular, for researchers investigating the role of word recognition in language comprehension."

Vallet,Behavior Research Methods,visual and auditory perceptual strength norms for 3596 french nouns and their relationship with other psycholinguistic variables,2019,"Perceptual experience plays a critical role in the conceptual representation of words. Higher levels of semantic variables such as imageability, concreteness, and sensory experience are generally associated with faster and more accurate word processing. Nevertheless, these variables tend to be assessed mostly on the basis of visual experience. This underestimates the potential contributions of other perceptual modalities. Accordingly, recent evidence has stressed the importance of providing modality-specific perceptual strength norms. In the present study, we developed French Canadian norms of visual and auditory perceptual strength (i.e., the modalities that have major impact on word processing) for 3,596 nouns. We then explored the relationship between these newly developed variables and other lexical, orthographic, and semantic variables. Finally, we demonstrated the contributions of visual and auditory perceptual strength ratings to visual word processing beyond those of other semantic variables related to perceptual experience (e.g., concreteness, imageability, and sensory experience ratings). The ratings developed in this study are a meaningful contribution toward the implementation of new studies that will shed further light on the interaction between linguistic, semantic, and perceptual systems."

However, norms for a crucial semantic variable—that is, conceptual familiarity—have not been available for a sizeable French database. We thus developed French Canadian conceptual familiarity norms for 3,596 nouns. This enriches Desrochers and Thompson’s (2009) database, in which subjective frequency and imageability values are already available for the same words. We collected online data from 313 Canadian French speakers. The full database of conceptual familiarity ratings is freely available at http://lingualab.ca/fr/projets/normes-de-familiarite-conceptuelle. We then demonstrated the utility of these new conceptual familiarity norms by assessing their contribution to lexical decision times. We conducted a stepwise regression model with conceptual familiarity in the last step. This allowed us to assess the independent contribution of conceptual familiarity beyond the contributions of other well-known psycholinguistic variables, such as frequency, imageability, and age of acquisition. The results showed that conceptual familiarity facilitated lexical decision latencies. In sum, these ratings will help researchers select French stimuli for experiments in which conceptual familiarity must be taken into account."

In this study, we expand on three previous databases of concepts to over 4000 words including nouns, verbs, adjectives, and other parts of speech. Participants in the study were asked to provide lists of features for each concept presented (a semantic feature production task), which were combined with previous research in this area. These feature lists for each concept were then coded into their root word form and affixes (i.e., cat and s for cats) to explore the impact of word form on semantic similarity measures, which are often calculated by comparing concept feature lists (feature overlap). All concept features, coding, and calculated similarity information is provided in a searchable database for easy access and utilization for future researchers when designing experiments that use word stimuli. The final database of word pairs was combined with the Semantic Priming Project to examine the relation of semantic similarity statistics on semantic priming in tandem with other psycholinguistic variables."
Romina A. San Miguel AbellaMaría González-Nosti,Behavior Research Methods,motor content norms for 4565 verbs in spanish,2019,"Embodiment theory suggests that, during the processing of words related to movement, as in the case of action verbs, somatotopic activation is produced in the motor and premotor cortices. In the same way, some studies have demonstrated that patients with frontal-lobe damage, such as Parkinson’s patients, have difficulties processing that kind of stimulus. At the moment, no standardized data exist concerning the motor content of Spanish verbs. Therefore, the aim of the present research was to develop a database of 4,565 verbs in Spanish through a survey filled out by 152 university students. The value for the motor content was obtained by calculating the average value from the answers of the participants. In addition, the reliability of the results was estimated, as well as their convergent validity, using diverse correlation coefficients. The database and the raw responses of the participants can be downloaded from this website: https://inco.grupos.uniovi.es/enlaces."
Geoff HollisChris Westbury,Behavior Research Methods,when is best worst best a comparison of best worst scaling numeric estimation and rating scales for collection of semantic norms,2018,"Large-scale semantic norms have become both prevalent and influential in recent psycholinguistic research. However, little attention has been directed towards understanding the methodological best practices of such norm collection efforts. We compared the quality of semantic norms obtained through rating scales, numeric estimation, and a less commonly used judgment format called best-worst scaling. We found that best-worst scaling usually produces norms with higher predictive validities than other response formats, and does so requiring less data to be collected overall. We also found evidence that the various response formats may be producing qualitatively, rather than just quantitatively, different data. This raises the issue of potential response format bias, which has not been addressed by previous efforts to collect semantic norms, likely because of previous reliance on a single type of response format for a single type of semantic judgment. We have made available software for creating best-worst stimuli and scoring best-worst data. We also made available new norms for age of acquisition, valence, arousal, and concreteness collected using best-worst scaling. These norms include entries for 1,040 words, of which 1,034 are also contained in the ANEW norms (Bradley & Lang, Affective norms for English words (ANEW): Instruction manual and affective ratings (pp. 1-45).

Ayşe Pinar SayginFrederic DickElizabeth Bates,Behavior Research Methods,an on line task for contrasting auditory processing in the verbal and nonverbal domains and norms for younger and older adults,2005,"Contrasting linguistic and nonlinguistic processing has been of interest to many researchers with different scientific, theoretical, or clinical questions. However, previous work on this type of comparative analysis and experimentation has been limited. In particular, little is known about the differences and similarities between the perceptual, cognitive, and neural processing of nonverbal environmental sounds and that of speech sounds. With the aim of contrasting verbal and nonverbal processing in the auditory modality, we developed a new on-line measure that can be administered to subjects from different clinical, neurological, or sociocultural groups. This is an on-line task of sound to picture matching, in which the sounds are either environmental sounds or their linguistic equivalents and which is controlled for potential task and item confounds across the two sound types. Here, we describe the design and development of our measure and report norming data for healthy subjects from two different adult age groups: younger adults (18–24 years of age) and older adults (54–78 years of age). We also outline other populations to which the test has been or is being administered. In addition to the results reported here, the test can be useful to other researchers who are interested in systematically contrasting verbal and nonverbal auditory processing in other populations."
Xiaocong ChenYanping DongXiufen Yu,Behavior Research Methods,on the predictive validity of various corpus based frequency norms in l2 english lexical processing,2018,"The predictive validity of various corpus-based frequency norms in first-language lexical processing has been intensively investigated in previous research, but less attention has been paid to this issue in second-language (L2) processing. To bridge the gap, in the present study we took English as a case in point and compared the predictive power of a large set of corpus-based frequency norms for the performance of an L2 English visual lexical decision task (LDT). Our results showed that, in general, the frequency norms from SUBTLEX-US and WorldLex–Blog tended to predict L2 performance better in reaction times, whereas the frequency norms from corpora with a mixture of written and spoken genres (CELEX, WorldLex–Blog, BNC, ANC, and COCA) tended to predict L2 accuracy better. Although replicated in both low- and high-proficiency L2 English learners, these patterns were not exactly the same as those found in LDT data from native English speakers. In addition, we only observed some limited advantages of the lemma frequency and contextual diversity measures over the wordform frequency measure in predicting L2 lexical processing. The results of the present study, especially the detailed comparisons among the different corpora, provide methodological implications for future L2 lexical research."
Marianna BolognesiRoosmaryn PilgramRomy van den Heerik,Behavior Research Methods,reliability in content analysis the case of semantic feature norms classification,2017,"Semantic feature norms (e.g., STIMULUS: car → RESPONSE: <has four wheels>) are commonly used in cognitive psychology to look into salient aspects of given concepts. Semantic features are typically collected in experimental settings and then manually annotated by the researchers into feature types (e.g., perceptual features, taxonomic features, etc.) by means of content analyses—that is, by using taxonomies of feature types and having independent coders perform the annotation task. However, the ways in which such content analyses are typically performed and reported are not consistent across the literature. This constitutes a serious methodological problem that might undermine the theoretical claims based on such annotations. In this study, we first offer a review of some of the released datasets of annotated semantic feature norms and the related taxonomies used for content analysis. We then provide theoretical and methodological insights in relation to the content analysis methodology. Finally, we apply content analysis to a new dataset of semantic features and show how the method should be applied in order to deliver reliable annotations and replicable coding schemes. We tackle the following issues: (1) taxonomy structure, (2) the description of categories, (3) coder training, and (4) sustainability of the coding scheme—that is, comparison of the annotations provided by trained versus novice coders. The outcomes of the project are threefold: We provide methodological guidelines for semantic feature classification; we provide a revised and adapted taxonomy that can (arguably) be applied to both concrete and abstract concepts; and we provide a dataset of annotated semantic feature norms."

If the object task also has high internal reliability, it can improve accuracy and power in group analyses (e.g., mean inversion effects for faces vs. objects), individual-difference studies (e.g., correlations between certain perceptual abilities and face/object recognition), and case studies in neuropsychology (e.g., whether a prosopagnosic shows a face-specific or object-general deficit). Here, we present such a task. Our Cambridge Car Memory Test (CCMT) was matched in format to the established Cambridge Face Memory Test, requiring recognition of exemplars across view and lighting change. We tested 153 young adults (93 female). Results showed high reliability (Cronbach's alpha = .84) and a range of scores suitable both for normal-range individual-difference studies and, potentially, for diagnosis of impairment. The mean for males was much higher than the mean for females. We demonstrate independence between face memory and car memory (dissociation based on sex, plus a modest correlation between the two), including where participants have high relative expertise with cars. We also show that expertise with real car makes and models of the era used in the test significantly predicts CCMT performance. Surprisingly, however, regression analyses imply that there is an effect of sex per se on the CCMT that is not attributable to a stereotypical male advantage in car expertise."
Caitlin A. RiceBarend BeekhuizenVladimir DubrovskySuzanne StevensonBlair C. Armstrong,Behavior Research Methods,a comparison of homonym meaning frequency estimates derived from movie and television subtitles free association and explicit ratings,2019,"Most words are ambiguous, with interpretation dependent on context. Advancing theories of ambiguity resolution is important for any general theory of language processing, and for resolving inconsistencies in observed ambiguity effects across experimental tasks. Focusing on homonyms (words such as bank with unrelated meanings EDGE OF A RIVER vs. FINANCIAL INSTITUTION), the present work advances theories and methods for estimating the relative frequency of their meanings, a factor that shapes observed ambiguity effects. We develop a new method for estimating meaning frequency based on the meaning of a homonym evoked in lines of movie and television subtitles according to human raters. We also replicate and extend a measure of meaning frequency derived from the classification of free associates. We evaluate the internal consistency of these measures, compare them to published estimates based on explicit ratings of each meaning’s frequency, and compare each set of norms in predicting performance in lexical and semantic decision mega-studies. All measures have high internal consistency and show agreement, but each is also associated with unique variance, which may be explained by integrating cognitive theories of memory with the demands of different experimental methodologies. To derive frequency estimates, we collected manual classifications of 533 homonyms over 50,000 lines of subtitles, and of 357 homonyms across over 5000 homonym–associate pairs. This database—publicly available at: www.blairarmstrong.net/homonymnorms/—constitutes a novel resource for computational cognitive modeling and computational linguistics, and we offer suggestions around good practices for its use in training and testing models on labeled data."

Study 1 describes the computational method of generating time-locked estimates of concreteness based on the Corpus of Historic American English, and makes available the computed scores for 25,000 English words over 15 decades. We also report several tests of reliability and validity, demonstrating that our historical concreteness scores have high levels of both. Study 2 uses concreteness scores to revisit findings of studies that use a static set of contemporary human concreteness norms to examine historical trends of semantic change. Specifically, we observed (contra Hills & Adelman, (Cognition, 143, 87–92 2015)) that distinct word types of the English language become increasingly more concrete over time and (in line with Hills & Adelman, (Cognition, 143, 87–92 2015) & Hills, Adelman & Noguchi, (The Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology, 70(8), 1603–1619 2016)) that relatively concrete words tend to be used more often than abstract ones. We discuss both contrastive and corroborative claims in light of recent work on semantic evolution and argue for the use of time-locked computed estimates over static human norms when examining diachronic linguistic phenomena."

TAALES 2.0 is housed on a user’s hard drive (allowing for secure data processing) and is available on most operating systems (Windows, Mac, and Linux). TAALES 2.0 adds 316 indices to the original tool. These indices are related to word frequency, word range, n-gram frequency, n-gram range, n-gram strength of association, contextual distinctiveness, word recognition norms, semantic network, and word neighbors. In this study, we validated TAALES 2.0 by investigating whether its indices could be used to model both holistic scores of lexical proficiency in free writes and word choice scores in narrative essays. The results indicated that the TAALES 2.0 indices could be used to explain 58% of the variance in lexical proficiency scores and 32% of the variance in word-choice scores. Newly added TAALES 2.0 indices, including those related to n-gram association strength, word neighborhood, and word recognition norms, featured heavily in these predictor models, suggesting that TAALES 2.0 represents a substantial upgrade."
Sergio E. ChaigneauEnrique CanessaCarlos BarraRodrigo Lagos,Behavior Research Methods,the role of variability in the property listing task,2018,"It is generally believed that concepts can be characterized by their properties (or features). When investigating concepts encoded in language, researchers often ask subjects to produce lists of properties that describe them (i.e., the Property Listing Task, PLT). These lists are accumulated to produce Conceptual Property Norms (CPNs). CPNs contain frequency distributions of properties for individual concepts. It is widely believed that these distributions represent the underlying semantic structure of those concepts. Here, instead of focusing on the underlying semantic structure, we aim at characterizing the PLT. An often disregarded aspect of the PLT is that individuals show intersubject variability (i.e., they produce only partially overlapping lists). In our study we use a mathematical analysis of this intersubject variability to guide our inquiry. To this end, we resort to a set of publicly available norms that contain information about the specific properties that were informed at the individual subject level. Our results suggest that when an individual is performing the PLT, he or she generates a list of properties that is a mixture of general and distinctive properties, such that there is a non-linear tendency to produce more general than distinctive properties. Furthermore, the low generality properties are precisely those that tend not to be repeated across lists, accounting in this manner for part of the intersubject variability. In consequence, any manipulation that may affect the mixture of general and distinctive properties in lists is bound to change intersubject variability. We discuss why these results are important for researchers using the PLT."

The uncertainty due to sampling variability in the norming phase is ignored. To express uncertainty due to norming, we propose a flexible method that is applicable in continuous norming and allows for a variety of score distributions, using Generalized Additive Models for Location, Scale, and Shape (GAMLSS; Rigby & Stasinopoulos, 2005). We assessed the performance of this method in a simulation study, by examining the quality of the resulting CIs. We varied the population model, procedure of estimating the CI, confidence level, sample size, value of the predictor, extremity of the test score, and type of variance-covariance matrix. The results showed that good quality of the CIs could be achieved in most conditions. The method is illustrated using normative data of the SON-R 6-40 test. We recommend test developers to use this approach to arrive at CIs, and thus properly express the uncertainty due to norm sampling fluctuations, in the context of continuous norming. Adopting this approach will help (e.g., clinical) practitioners to obtain a fair picture of the person assessed."

Yap,Behavior Research Methods,quantifying sensorimotor experience bodyobject interaction ratings for more than 9000 english words,2019,"Ratings of body–object interaction (BOI) measure the ease with which the human body can interact with a word’s referent. Researchers have studied the effects of BOI in order to investigate the relationships between sensorimotor and cognitive processes. Such efforts could be improved, however, by the availability of more extensive BOI norms. In the present work, we collected BOI ratings for over 9,000 words. These new norms show good reliability and validity and have extensive overlap with the words used both in other lexical and semantic norms and in the available behavioral megastudies (e.g., the English Lexicon Project, Balota, Yap, Cortese, Hutchison, Kessler, & Loftis in Behavior Research Methods, 39, 445–459, 2007; and the Calgary Semantic Decision Project, Pexman, Heard, Lloyd, & Yap in Behavior Research Methods, 49, 407–417, 2017). In analyses using the new BOI norms, we found that high-BOI words tended to be more concrete, more graspable, and more strongly associated with sensory, haptic, and visual experience than are low-BOI words. When we used the new norms to predict response latencies and accuracy data from the behavioral megastudies, we found that BOI was a stronger predictor of responses in the semantic decision task than in the lexical decision task. These findings are consistent with a dynamic, multidimensional account of lexical semantics. The norms described here should be useful for future research examining the effects of sensorimotor experience on performance in tasks involving word stimuli."
Geoff Hollis,Behavior Research Methods,the role of number of items per trial in bestworst scaling experiments,2019,"Best–worst scaling is a judgment format in which participants are presented with K items and must choose the best and worst items from that set, along some underlying latent dimension. Best–worst scaling has seen recent use in natural-language processing and psychology to collect lexical semantic norms. In such applications, four items have always been presented on each trial. The present study provides reasoning that values other than 4 might provide better estimates of latent values. The results from simulation experiments and behavioral research confirmed this: Both suggest that, in the general case, six items per trial better reduces errors in the latent value estimates."

The present study compares paper and Internet administrations of the Multidimensional Health Locus of Control (MHLC) Scale (Wallston & Wallston, 1981). In terms of reliabilities and factor structures, the Internet data were found to be at least as good as the paper data. MHLC scores were comparable for paper and Internet administrations, although the Internet sample scored significantly lower on the Powerful Others subscale. Overall, the results show that administration of the MHLC Scale via the Internet can produce data comparable to that obtained by pen-and-paper methods. However, it is concluded that generalization of these findings beyond the psychometric test instrument and sampling procedures used here is not warranted."

Bram Van RensbergenSimon De DeyneGert Storms,Behavior Research Methods,estimating affective word covariates using word association data,2016,"Word ratings on affective dimensions are an important tool in psycholinguistic research. Traditionally, they are obtained by asking participants to rate words on each dimension, a time-consuming procedure. As such, there has been some interest in computationally generating norms, by extrapolating words’ affective ratings using their semantic similarity to words for which these values are already known. So far, most attempts have derived similarity from word co-occurrence in text corpora. In the current paper, we obtain similarity from word association data. We use these similarity ratings to predict the valence, arousal, and dominance of 14,000 Dutch words with the help of two extrapolation methods: Orientation towards Paradigm Words and k-Nearest Neighbors. The resulting estimates show very high correlations with human ratings when using Orientation towards Paradigm Words, and even higher correlations when using k-Nearest Neighbors. We discuss possible theoretical accounts of our results and compare our findings with previous attempts at computationally generating affective norms."
Michael KruepkeErin K. MolloyKonrad BresinAron K. BarbeyEdelyn Verona,Behavior Research Methods,a brief assessment tool for investigating facets of moral judgment from realistic vignettes,2018,"Humans make moral judgments every day, and research demonstrates that these evaluations are based on a host of related event features (e.g., harm, legality). In order to acquire systematic data on how moral judgments are made, our assessments need to be expanded to include real-life, ecologically valid stimuli that take into account the numerous event features that are known to influence moral judgment. To facilitate this, Knutson et al. (in Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience, 5(4), 378–384, 2010) developed vignettes based on real-life episodic memories rated concurrently on key moral features; however, the method is time intensive (~1.4–3.4 h) and the stimuli and ratings require further validation and characterization. The present study addresses these limitations by: (i) validating three short subsets of these vignettes (39 per subset) that are time-efficient (10–25 min per subset) yet representative of the ratings and factor structure of the full set, (ii) norming ratings of moral features in a larger sample (total N = 661, each subset N = ~220 vs. Knutson et al. N = 30), (iii) examining the generalizability of the original factor structure by replicating it in a larger sample across vignette subsets, sex, and political ideology, and (iv) using latent profile analysis to empirically characterize vignette groupings based on event feature ratings profiles and vignette content. This study therefore provides researchers with a core battery of well-characterized and realistic vignettes, concurrently rated on key moral features that can be administered in a brief, time-efficient manner to advance research on the nature of moral judgment."

In many of these studies, participants are typically told to learn foreign language–English translations, such as Swahili–English or Lithuanian–English pairs. One limitation of these currently available foreign language–English translation norms is that their foreign languages are based on the alphabetic writing system, thereby preventing researchers from generalizing their findings to languages based on logographic writing systems. In the present study we collected normative data for 160 Chinese–English word pairs. Participants completed three study–test cycles, followed by metacognitive judgments on their learning experience. For each pair, we report recall performance, recall latency, ease of learning, and judgments of learning. A simultaneous multiple regression analysis with frequency (of both the English word and the Chinese character), word length (English), and number of strokes (Chinese) as predictors revealed that a greater number of strokes (or higher visual complexity) for the Chinese characters predicted lower target recall."
Lewis Pollock,Behavior Research Methods,statistical and methodological problems with concreteness and other semantic variables a list memory experiment case study,2018,"The purpose of this article is to highlight problems with a range of semantic psycholinguistic variables (concreteness, imageability, individual modality norms, and emotional valence) and to provide a way of avoiding these problems. Focusing on concreteness, I show that for a large class of words in the Brysbaert, Warriner, and Kuperman (Behavior Research Methods 46: 904–911, 2013) concreteness norms, the mean concreteness values do not reflect the judgments that actual participants made. This problem applies to nearly every word in the middle of the concreteness scale. Using list memory experiments as a case study, I show that many of the “abstract” stimuli in concreteness experiments are not unequivocally abstract. Instead, they are simply those words about which participants tend to disagree. I report three replications of list memory experiments in which the contrast between concrete and abstract stimuli was maximized, so that the mean concreteness values were accurate reflections of participants’ judgments. The first two experiments did not produce a concreteness effect. After I introduced an additional control, the third experiment did produce a concreteness effect. The article closes with a discussion of the implications of these results, as well as a consideration of variables other than concreteness. The sensorimotor experience variables (imageability and individual modality norms) show the same distribution as concreteness. The distribution of emotional valence scores is healthier, but variability in ratings takes on a special significance for this measure because of how the scale is constructed. I recommend that researchers using these variables keep the standard deviations of the ratings of their stimuli as low as possible."

In the present study, we have provided norms on the extent to which participants agreed about the movements typically performed for using specific objects—what we will call manipulability agreement. We showed that manipulability agreement was a good predictor of the times needed to initiate the action associated with the object. This study provides ratings on a new dimension of objects’ motor affordances that could be useful to researchers in the domain of visual cognition."

Lance W. Hahn,Behavior Research Methods,measuring local context as contextword probabilities,2012,"Context enables readers to quickly recognize a related word but disturbs recognition of unrelated words. The relatedness of a final word to a sentence context has been estimated as the probability (cloze probability) that a participant will complete a sentence with a word. In four studies, I show that it is possible to estimate local context–word relatedness based on common language usage. Conditional probabilities were calculated for sentences with published cloze probabilities. Four-word contexts produced conditional probabilities significantly correlated with cloze probabilities, but usage statistics were unavailable for some sentence contexts. The present studies demonstrate that a composite context measure based on conditional probabilities for one- to four-word contexts and the presence of a final period represents all of the sentences and maintains significant correlations (.25, .52, .53) with cloze probabilities. Finally, the article provides evidence for the effectiveness of this measure by showing that local context varies in ways that are similar to the N400 effect and that are consistent with a role for local context in reading. The Supplemental materials include local context measures for three cloze probability data sets."
Simon De DeyneGert Storms,Behavior Research Methods,word associations network and semantic properties,2008,"A number of properties of word associations, generated in a continuous task, were investigated. First, we investigated the correspondence of word class in association cues and responses. Nouns were the modal word class response, regardless of the word class of the cue, indicating a dominant paradigmatic response style. Next, the word association data were used to build an associative network to investigate the centrality of nodes. The study of node centrality showed that central nodes in the network tended to be highly frequent and acquired early. Small-world properties of the association network were investigated and compared with a large English association network (Steyvers & Tenenbaum, 2005). Networks based on a multiple association procedure showed small-world properties despite being denser than networks based on a discrete task. Finally, a semantic taxonomy was used to investigate the composition of semantic types in association responses. The majority of responses were thematically related situation responses and entity responses referring to parts, shape, or color. Since the association task required multiple responses per cue, the interaction between generation position and semantic role could be investigated and discussed in the framework of recent theories of natural concept representations (Barsalou, Santos, Simmons, & Wilson, in press)."

The system runs under MS-DOS. The shell program integrates subject information with data obtained through the use of the individual test programs. The current test battery comprises tasks on memory, attention, and motor performance; these tasks require the use of additional peripheral response devices, which are controlled via a multiple I/O interface card. Questionnaires are also included; they have been developed with the author language shell program MicroCAT. MINDS is programmed to allow easy integration of new tests. As an example, the Motor Planning Test is described. The equivalence of the computerized questionnaires with existing tests is also discussed."

Geoff Hollis,Behavior Research Methods,scoring best worst data in unbalanced many item designs with applications to crowdsourcing semantic judgments,2018,"Best-worst scaling is a judgment format in which participants are presented with a set of items and have to choose the superior and inferior items in the set. Best-worst scaling generates a large quantity of information per judgment because each judgment allows for inferences about the rank value of all unjudged items. This property of best-worst scaling makes it a promising judgment format for research in psychology and natural language processing concerned with estimating the semantic properties of tens of thousands of words. A variety of different scoring algorithms have been devised in the previous literature on best-worst scaling. However, due to problems of computational efficiency, these scoring algorithms cannot be applied efficiently to cases in which thousands of items need to be scored. New algorithms are presented here for converting responses from best-worst scaling into item scores for thousands of items (many-item scoring problems). These scoring algorithms are validated through simulation and empirical experiments, and considerations related to noise, the underlying distribution of true values, and trial design are identified that can affect the relative quality of the derived item scores. The newly introduced scoring algorithms consistently outperformed scoring algorithms used in the previous literature on scoring many-item best-worst data."

This article introduces the spreadr R package, which can implement spreading activation within a specified network structure. The algorithmic method implemented in the spreadr subroutines follows the approach described in Vitevitch, Ercal, and Adagarla (Frontiers in Psychology, 2, 369, 2011), who viewed activation as a fixed cognitive resource that could “spread” among connected nodes in a network. Three sets of simulations were conducted using the package. The first set of simulations successfully reproduced the results reported in Vitevitch et al. (Frontiers in Psychology, 2, 369, 2011), who showed that a simple mechanism of spreading activation could account for the clustering coefficient effect in spoken word recognition. The second set of simulations showed that the same mechanism could be extended to account for higher false alarm rates for low clustering coefficient words in a false memory task. The final set of simulations demonstrated how spreading activation could be applied to a semantic network to account for semantic priming effects. It is hoped that this package will encourage cognitive and language scientists to explicitly consider how the structures of cognitive systems such as the mental lexicon and semantic memory interact with the process of spreading activation."

To a considerable extent, animals from an inbred strain represent replicate individuals. Different naive samples from the same strain may be tested in different forms of a test. There is presumptive evidence that the two forms arc assessing similar functions if samples from different strains that differ on the behavior give consistent ordinal rankings. An illustration is given of the use of this approach in assessing methods of measuring alcohol preference in mice."

Several design features of the survey procedure have been suggested to counteract this problem; particularly, computerized surveys are supposed to elicit more truthful responding. This assumption was tested in a meta-analysis of survey experiments reporting 460 effect sizes (total N =125,672). Self-reported prevalence rates of several sensitive behaviors for which motivated misreporting has been frequently observed were compared across self-administered paper-and-pencil versus computerized surveys. The results revealed that computerized surveys led to significantly more reporting of socially undesirable behaviors than comparable surveys administered on paper. This effect was strongest for highly sensitive behaviors and surveys administered individually to respondents. Moderator analyses did not identify interviewer effects or benefits of audio-enhanced computer surveys. The meta-analysis highlighted the advantages of computerized survey modes for the assessment of sensitive topics."

In a large-scale study with Dutch and Korean speakers of L2 English, we tested whether LexTALE, a 5-min vocabulary test, is a valid predictor of English vocabulary knowledge and, possibly, even of general English proficiency. Furthermore, the validity of LexTALE was compared with that of self-ratings of proficiency, a measure frequently used by L2 researchers. The results showed the following in both speaker groups: (1) LexTALE was a good predictor of English vocabulary knowledge; 2) it also correlated substantially with a measure of general English proficiency; and 3) LexTALE was generally superior to self-ratings in its predictions. LexTALE, but not self-ratings, also correlated highly with previous experimental data on two word recognition paradigms. The test can be carried out on or downloaded from www.lextale.com."

From trial to trial, the amplitude function comes more and more to be due to the behavior of Ss who initially make large responses. Even though the latter Ss’ responses actually reduce across trials, the amplitude function rises. Magnitude (including zeroes) docs not suffer from this distortion. It is suggested that the definition of a zero response is the source of the problem."

This article describes three studies in which a new virtual reality paradigm was used, in which participants had to escape from a burning underground rail station. Study 1 was carried out in an immersion laboratory and demonstrated that collective identification in the crowd was enhanced by the (shared) threat embodied in emergency itself. In Study 2, high-identification participants were more helpful and pushed less than did low-identification participants. In Study 3, identification and group size were experimentally manipulated, and similar results were obtained. These results support a hypothesis according to which (emergent) collective identity motivates solidarity with strangers.

Although most listeners seem sensitive to vocal mistuning, little is known about the development of this perceptual ability or how it differs between listeners. Motivated by a lack of suitable preexisting measures, we introduce in this article an adaptive and ecologically valid test of mistuning perception ability. The stimulus material consisted of short excerpts (6 to 12 s in length) from pop music performances (obtained from MedleyDB; Bittner et al., 2014) for which the vocal track was pitch-shifted relative to the instrumental tracks. In a first experiment, 333 listeners were tested on a two-alternative forced choice task that tested discrimination between a pitch-shifted and an unaltered version of the same audio clip. Explanatory item response modeling was then used to calibrate an adaptive version of the test. A subsequent validation experiment applied this adaptive test to 66 participants with a broad range of musical expertise, producing evidence of the test’s reliability, convergent validity, and divergent validity. The test is ready to be deployed as an experimental tool and should make an important contribution to our understanding of the human ability to judge mistuning."

A neuropsychological case example, with an EDS Personal Report, is complemented by statistical findings from (1) working-age drivers (norms), (2) patients with central nervous system impairment seeking driver rehabilitation, and (3) a large sample of older drivers. The EDS proved to be a challenging procedure that all the normals completed more consistently, efficiently, and accurately than the other groups. Clinically, it discriminated extreme cases and, for those who fell in between, it helped focus the issues for further assessment and intervention. The discussion addresses how much realism is necessary, as well as the psychometric limitations of on-road testing."

Data were collected for a convenience sample on both the T3 and the Reitan finger-tapping test. Moderate and significant correlations were obtained between the T3 and the Reitan test for both hands. Mean scores for the first 50 sec of the T3 were approximately 0.15 taps greater than the mean Reitan score for both the preferred and the nonpreferred hands, while the mean scores for the full 2 min of the T3 were 1.52 taps less than those of the Reitan test for the preferred hand, and 1.32 taps less for the nonpreferred hand. The mean for the last 40 sec with the preferred hand averaged 3.93 taps (7.62%) slower than for the first 40 sec, whereas for the nonpreferred hand, the difference was 5.12 taps (11.15%). These results are consistent with our intent to develop measures of (1) relatively pure motor speed (the first 50 sec of the T3); (2) motor speed combined with endurance (the full 2 min of the T3); and (3) finger endurance (the first 40 sec compared with the last 40 sec of the T3)."

Object recognition, however, relies on distinct mid-level processes of perceptual organization that are only implicitly tested in classical tests. The Leuven Perceptual Organization Screening Test (L-POST) fills a gap with respect to clinically oriented tests of mid-level visual function. In 15 online subtests, a range of mid-level processes are covered, such as figure–ground segmentation, local and global processing, and shape perception. We also test the sensitivity to a wide variety of perceptual grouping cues, like common fate, collinearity, proximity, and closure. To reduce cognitive load, a matching-to-sample task is used for all subtests. Our online test can be administered in 20–45 min and is freely available at www.gestaltrevision.be/tests. The online implementation enables us to offer a separate interface for researchers and clinicians to have immediate access to the raw and summary results for each patient and to keep a record of their patient’s entire data. Also, each patient’s results can be flexibly compared with a range of age-matched norm samples. In conclusion, the L-POST is a valuable screening test for perceptual organization. The test allows clinicians to screen for deficits in visual perception and enables researchers to get a broader overview of mid-level visual processes that are preserved or disrupted in a given patient."
Alexandra C. ConstantinescuMaria WoltersAdam MooreSarah E.

Despite its extensive use, selecting IAPS stimuli for a research project is not usually done according to an established strategy, but rather is tailored to individual studies. Here we propose a standard, replicable method for stimulus selection based on cluster analysis, which re-creates the group structure that is most likely to have produced the valence arousal, and dominance norms associated with the IAPS images. Our method includes screening the database for outliers, identifying a suitable clustering solution, and then extracting the desired number of stimuli on the basis of their level of certainty of belonging to the cluster they were assigned to. Our method preserves statistical power in studies by maximizing the likelihood that the stimuli belong to the cluster structure fitted to them, and by filtering stimuli according to their certainty of cluster membership. In addition, although our cluster-based method is illustrated using the IAPS, it can be extended to other stimulus databases."

Subjects also showed large savings for the repeated pictures (perceptual learning), indexed by a decrease in thresholds from the new to the old set."
David L. NeumannPatrick R. Thomas,Behavior Research Methods,a camera based scoring system for evaluating performance accuracy during a golf putting task,2008,"Golf putting accuracy is often evaluated by measuring the distance that the ball finishes from the hole. However, accuracy is a function of line and length, and distance-from-hole measures confound these two factors. A scoring system for evaluating putting accuracy is described that enables the efficient measurement of errors in line and length. A camera placed above the hole takes digital photographs of the final position of the ball. A custom-developed program written in the National Instruments LabVIEW graphical programming language derives a variety of accuracy measures from these photographs, including distance from the hole, angle of error, distance short or long from the hole, and distance left or right from the hole. Evaluation of the system indicated that the measures were as accurate as manual measurements and were reliable when rescored on separate occasions. The camera-based scoring system presents a number of advantages in the evaluation of putting accuracy and may be extended to examine performance in other sports.

Gerardo OrtegaAslı Özyürek,Behavior Research Methods,systematic mappings between semantic categories and types of iconic representations in the manual modality a normed database of silent gesture,2019,"An unprecedented number of empirical studies have shown that iconic gestures—those that mimic the sensorimotor attributes of a referent—contribute significantly to language acquisition, perception, and processing. However, there has been a lack of normed studies describing generalizable principles in gesture production and in comprehension of the mappings of different types of iconic strategies (i.e., modes of representation; Müller, 2013). In Study 1 we elicited silent gestures in order to explore the implementation of different types of iconic representation (i.e., acting, representing, drawing, and personification) to express concepts across five semantic domains. In Study 2 we investigated the degree of meaning transparency (i.e., iconicity ratings) of the gestures elicited in Study 1. We found systematicity in the gestural forms of 109 concepts across all participants, with different types of iconicity aligning with specific semantic domains: Acting was favored for actions and manipulable objects, drawing for nonmanipulable objects, and personification for animate entities. Interpretation of gesture–meaning transparency was modulated by the interaction between mode of representation and semantic domain, with some couplings being more transparent than others: Acting yielded higher ratings for actions, representing for object-related concepts, personification for animate entities, and drawing for nonmanipulable entities. This study provides mapping principles that may extend to all forms of manual communication (gesture and sign). This database includes a list of the most systematic silent gestures in the group of participants, a notation of the form of each gesture based on four features (hand configuration, orientation, placement, and movement), each gesture’s mode of representation, iconicity ratings, and professionally filmed videos that can be used for experimental and clinical endeavors."
Olaf LahlReinhard Pietrowsky,Behavior Research Methods,tracer a general purpose software library for logging events in computerized experiments,2008,"In certain areas of the behavioral sciences, such as cognitive and perceptual psychology, researchers may choose to have their experiments partially or completely driven by software programs, which instruct and guide subjects through the sequence of tasks. Despite distinct advantages of unattended trial execution, on frequent occasions, experimenters may desire to keep track of the progress or to be notified of certain events, such as when the subject has completed a task. The Tracer software library presented here is a lightweight Windows programming interface that provides experimenters the ability to trace events and status notifications on one or more remote computers and log files.

A rate-limiting factor in answering such questions is the challenge of recruiting rare DP participants. Although self-reported experiences have long played a role in efforts to identify DPs, much remains unknown about how such self-reports can or should contribute to screening or diagnosis. Here, in a large, population-based web sample, we investigated the effectiveness of self-report, used on its own, as a screen to identify individuals who will ultimately fail, at a conventional cutoff, the two types of objective tests that are most commonly used to confirm DP diagnoses: the Cambridge Face Memory Test (CFMT) and the famous faces memory test (FFMT). We used a highly reliable questionnaire (alpha = .91), the Cambridge Face Memory Questionnaire (CFMQ), and revealed strong validity via high correlations of .44 with the CFMT and .52 with the FFMT. However, cutoff analyses revealed that no CFMQ score yielded a clinical-grade combination of sensitivity and positive predictive value in enough individuals to support using it alone as a DP diagnostic or screening tool. This result was replicated in an analysis of data from the widely used PI20 questionnaire, a 20-question self-assessment of facial recognition similar in form to the CFMQ. We therefore recommend that screens for DP should, wherever possible, include objective as well as subjective assessment tools."

In this article, we describe the mediated moderation model and evaluate it with a statistical simulation using an adaptation of product-of-coefficients methods to assess mediation. We also demonstrate the use of this method with a substantive example from the adolescent tobacco literature. In the simulation, relative bias (RB) in point estimates and standard errors did not exceed problematic levels of ±10%, although systematic variability in RB was accounted for by parameter size, sample size, and nonzero direct effects. Power to detect mediated moderation effects appears to be severely compromised under one particular combination of conditions: when the component variables that make up the interaction terms are correlated and partial mediated moderation exists. Implications for the estimation of mediated moderation effects in experimental and nonexperimental research are discussed."

Nineteen percent of those who received the messages responded, in all cases by returning the message to the “sender” instead of forwarding it to the “recipient.” In the second study, attitudes toward presidential candidate Ross Perot were examined by sending out two different messages to 200 randomly selected e-mail addresses in the United States. Although there was no differential response rate, examination of content revealed attitudes consistent with concurrent poll data."

Ping LiBenjamin SchlossD. Jake Follmer,Behavior Research Methods,speaking two languages in america a semantic space analysis of how presidential candidates and their supporters represent abstract political concepts differently,2017,"In this article we report a computational semantic analysis of the presidential candidates’ speeches in the two major political parties in the USA. In Study One, we modeled the political semantic spaces as a function of party, candidate, and time of election, and findings revealed patterns of differences in the semantic representation of key political concepts and the changing landscapes in which the presidential candidates align or misalign with their parties in terms of the representation and organization of politically central concepts. Our models further showed that the 2016 US presidential nominees had distinct conceptual representations from those of previous election years, and these patterns did not necessarily align with their respective political parties’ average representation of the key political concepts. In Study Two, structural equation modeling demonstrated that reported political engagement among voters differentially predicted reported likelihoods of voting for Clinton versus Trump in the 2016 presidential election. Study Three indicated that Republicans and Democrats showed distinct, systematic word association patterns for the same concepts/terms, which could be reliably distinguished using machine learning methods. These studies suggest that given an individual’s political beliefs, we can make reliable predictions about how they understand words, and given how an individual understands those same words, we can also predict an individual’s political beliefs. Our study provides a bridge between semantic space models and abstract representations of political concepts on the one hand, and the representations of political concepts and citizens’ voting behavior on the other."
Wim Van der ElstGeert MolenberghsMartin P. J. Van BoxtelJelle Jolles,Behavior Research Methods,establishing normative data for repeated cognitive assessment a comparison of different statistical methods,2013,"Serial cognitive assessment is conducted to monitor changes in the cognitive abilities of patients over time. At present, mainly the regression-based change and the ANCOVA approaches are used to establish normative data for serial cognitive assessment. These methods are straightforward, but they have some severe drawbacks. For example, they can only consider the data of two measurement occasions. In this article, we propose three alternative normative methods that are not hampered by these problems—that is, multivariate regression, the standard linear mixed model (LMM), and the linear mixed model combined with multiple imputation (LMM with MI) approaches. The multivariate regression method is primarily useful when a small number of repeated measurements are taken at fixed time points. When the data are more unbalanced, the standard LMM and the LMM with MI methods are more appropriate because they allow for a more adequate modeling of the covariance structure. The standard LMM has the advantage that it is easier to conduct and that it does not require a Monte Carlo component. The LMM with MI, on the other hand, has the advantage that it can flexibly deal with missing responses and missing covariate values at the same time. The different normative methods are illustrated on the basis of the data of a large longitudinal study in which a cognitive test (the Stroop Color Word Test) was administered at four measurement occasions (i.e., at baseline and 3, 6, and 12 years later). The results are discussed and suggestions for future research are provided."
Cyril PerretPatrick Bonin,Behavior Research Methods,which variables should be controlled for to investigate picture naming in adults a bayesian meta analysis,2018,"Selecting items for designing psycholinguistic experiments can be a very hard and time-consuming process, because of the large number of variables that need to be controlled for. This is clearly the case for picture-naming experiments because, thanks to the collection of psycholinguistic norms on both pictures and their names, a large number of factors that affect naming speed and/or accuracy have been found. In the present study, a Bayesian meta-analysis was performed to determine the extent to which the variables that have generally been considered by researchers as important to control for are indeed worth taking into account. The meta-analysis revealed that most of the variables that are considered in picture-naming studies have a strong or very strong influence on naming speed (image agreement, name agreement, image variability/imageability, age of acquisition, and conceptual familiarity), whereas two variables that are very often taken into account (visual complexity and length) yielded null effects. The results were inconclusive for lexical frequency. At a methodological level, Bayesian meta-analyses constitute a very useful tool for guiding researchers when selecting materials for experiments."
Matthew D. PickardD. WilsonCatherine A. Roster,Behavior Research Methods,development and application of a self report measure for assessing sensitive information disclosures across multiple modes,2018,"Building on the literature that approaches self-disclosure as a decision-making process, we proposed a self-reported Sensitive Information Disclosure (SID) measure and tested the measure’s reliability and validity in two studies across a variety of interview modes and settings. We used theory to identify potential dimensions of sensitive information disclosures, created potential scale items, performed two separate card sorts, and validated the resulting pool of items in two separate experiments. Participants answered the SID scale items following an interview involving sensitive information, potential risk, and after-disclosure vulnerability. Study 1 was a laboratory experiment conducted with 165 university students. Exploratory factor analysis results revealed a two-factor structure, Personal Discomfort and Revealing Personal Information. Study 2 replicated these procedures using confirmatory factor analysis to confirm the factor structure and demonstrate the scale’s reliability and validity, with a sample of 77 students and 275 participants from Amazon’s M-Turk. Together, these results demonstrate that the proposed 11-item SID scale has good convergent and discriminant validity as well as good reliability. A quasi-experimental application of the measure is illustrated using the substantive findings from Study 2. This research fills a gap in the literature by developing a topic-free scale to measure SID as a dependent variable. The ability to accurately measure sensitive information disclosure is an important and necessary step toward developing a more thorough understanding of how people feel and react when asked to provide personal information in diverse interview settings."

The methods compared were linear discriminant analyses based both on raw scores and on ranks; linear logistic discrimination; and mixture discriminant analysis. Linear discriminant analysis and linear logistic discrimination were suboptimal in a number of scenarios with skewed predictors. Linear discriminant analysis based on ranks yielded the highest rates of classification accuracy in only a limited number of situations and did not produce a practically important advantage over competing methods. Mixture discriminant analysis, with a relatively small number of components in each group, attained relatively high rates of classification accuracy and was most useful for conditions in which skewed predictors had relatively small values of kurtosis."

David J.

Although studies comparing the attentiveness of participants on MTurk versus traditional subject pool samples have provided mixed support for this concern, attention check questions and other methods of ensuring participant attention have become prolific in MTurk studies. Because MTurk is a population that learns, we hypothesized that MTurkers would be more attentive to instructions than are traditional subject pool samples. In three online studies, participants from MTurk and collegiate populations participated in a task that included a measure of attentiveness to instructions (an instructional manipulation check: IMC). In all studies, MTurkers were more attentive to the instructions than were college students, even on novel IMCs (Studies 2 and 3), and MTurkers showed larger effects in response to a minute text manipulation. These results have implications for the sustainable use of MTurk samples for social science research and for the conclusions drawn from research with MTurk and college subject pool samples."

Stephen W. LinkRichard B. Day,"Behavior Research Methods, Instruments, & Computers",a theory of cheating,1992,"The theory of motivated cheating postulates that test takers may cheat when they do not know an answer. With probabilityk, an “observer” is unsure of an answer and will copy from a nearby “target” with probabilityc. The corresponding parameters for the target may be entirely unrelated to those of the observer. Thus, the undesirable feature of bidirectionality of parameters found in correlational techniques is not an inherent feature of this theory of cheating. Predictions are derived, and estimates ofk andc are proposed. Statistically large values of c suggest that an observer was copying from a target. High values ofc for both the observer and the target suggest collusion. The theory is applied to a 40-item five-choice test taken by students in an introductory psychology section. From the full paired comparison matrix of target × observer parameter estimates, the method identifies 2 students who were probably in collusion."
Inbal Arnon,Behavior Research Methods,do current statistical learning tasks capture stable individual differences in children an investigation of task reliability across modality,2019,"Do commonly used statistical-learning tasks capture stable individual differences in children? Infants, children, and adults are capable of using statistical learning (SL) to extract information about their environment. Although most studies have looked at group-level performance, a growing literature examines individual differences in SL and their relation to language-learning outcomes: Individuals who are better at SL are expected to show better linguistic abilities. Accordingly, studies have shown positive correlations between SL performance and language outcomes in both children and adults. However, these studies have often used tasks designed to explore group-level performance without modifying them, resulting in psychometric shortcomings that impact reliability in adults (Siegelman, Bogaerts, Christiansen, & Frost in Transactions of the Royal Society B, 372, 20160059, 2017a; Siegelman, Bogaerts, & Frost in Behavior Research Methods, 49, 418–432, 2017b). Even though similar measures are used to assess individual differences in children, no study to date has examined the reliability of these measures in development. This study examined the reliability of common SL measures in both children and adults. It assessed the reliability of three SL tasks (two auditory and one visual) twice (two months apart) in adults and children (mean age 8 years). Although the tasks showed moderate reliability in adults, they did not capture stable individual variation in children. None of the tasks were reliable across sessions, and all showed internal consistency measures well below psychometric standards. These findings raise significant concerns about the use of current SL measures to predict and explain individual differences in development. The article ends with a discussion of possible explanations for the difference in reliability between children and adults."

A primary technique that has been used to examine bilingual memory is an examination of cross-language word priming (semantic and translation), using the lexical decision and pronunciation tasks. Although studies have, on occasion, revealed greater degrees of word priming from a dominant to a subordinate language, in comparison with the reverse, a careful review of the methodology that has been used reveals a number of issues that render conclusions such as this quite problematic. Parameters of concern include language proficiency, cognate status, masking, control conditions, word frequency and length, stimulus onset asynchrony, relatedness proportion, and nonword ratio. These factors are discussed, as well as recommendations for conducting future empirical research in this area of investigation."

Apart from collecting writing latencies, durations, and accuracy, we also compiled 14 lexical variables for each character. Regressions showed that frequency, age of acquisition, and the word context (in which a character appears) are all-around and influential predictors of orthographic access (as reflected in writing latency), motor execution of handwriting (as reflected in writing duration), and accuracy. In addition, phonological factors (phonogram status, spelling regularity, and homophone density) impacted orthographic access but not handwriting execution. Semantic factors (imageability and concreteness) only affected accuracy. These results suggest, among other things, that phonology is consulted in orthographic access while handwriting. As the first of its kind, this database can be used as a source of secondary data analyses and a tool for stimulus construction in handwriting research."

This is particularly clear in the case of prediction models, such as the continuous skip-gram model introduced in Mikolov, Chen, Corrado, and Dean (2013), because these models depend on functionality closely related to the simple Rescorla–Wagner model of discriminant learning in nonhuman animals (Rescorla & Wagner, 1972), which has a rich history within psychology as a model of many animal learning processes. We replicate and extend earlier work showing that it is possible to extract accurate information about syntactic category and morphological family membership directly from patterns of word co-occurrence, and provide evidence from four experiments showing that this information predicts human reaction times and accuracy for class membership decisions."

This article introduces a new free-access program called PLAViMoP (Point-Light Display Visualization and Modification Platform) and presents the algorithms for PLD transformations actually included in the software. PLAViMoP fulfills two objectives. First, it standardizes and makes clear many classical spatial and kinematic transformations described in the PLD literature. Furthermore, given its optimized interface, PLAViMOP makes these transformations easy and fast to achieve. Overall, PLAViMoP could directly help scientists avoid technical difficulties and make possible the use of PLDs for nonacademic applications."

This involves understanding changes in what words meant, how words were used, and how these changes may have responded to changes in the environment, such as in healthcare, wealth disparity, and war. Here we make available a tool, the Macroscope, for studying historical changes in language over the last two centuries. The Macroscope uses over 155 billion words of historical text, which will grow as we include new historical corpora, and derives word properties from frequency-of-usage and co-occurrence patterns over time. Using co-occurrence patterns, the Macroscope can track changes in semantics, allowing researchers to identify semantically stable and unstable words in historical text and providing quantitative information about changes in a word’s valence, arousal, and concreteness, as well as information about new properties, such as semantic drift. The Macroscope provides information about both the local and global properties of words, as well as information about how these properties change over time, allowing researchers to visualize and download data in order to make inferences about historical psychology. Although quantitative historical psychology represents a largely new field of study, we see this work as complementing a wealth of other historical investigations, offering new insights and new approaches to understanding existing theory.

The goal of the present study was to validate the Satisfaction With Life Scale (SWLS; Diener, Emmons, Larsen, & Griffin, 1985), the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS-X; Watson & Clark, 1994), and the Subjective Happiness Scale (SHS; Lyubomirsky & Lepper, 1999) for use on the Internet. This study compared the quality of data collected using paper-based (paper-and-pencil version in a lab setting), computer-based (Web-based version in a lab setting), and Internet (Web-based version on a computer of the participant’s choosing) surveys for these three measures of SWB. The paper-based and computer-based experiment recruited two college student samples; the Internet experiments recruited a college student sample and an adult sample responding to ads on different social-networking Web sites. This study provides support for the reliability, validity, and generalizability of the Internet format of the SWLS, PANAS-X, and SHS. Across the three experiments, the results indicate that the computer-based and Internet surveys had means, standard deviations, reliabilities, and factor structures that were similar to those of the paper-based versions. The discussion examines the difficulty of higher attrition for the Internet version, the need to examine reverse-coded items in the future, and the possibility that unhappy individuals are more likely to participate in Internet surveys of SWB."

RichardsonTomaso Vecchi,"Behavior Research Methods, Instruments, & Computers",a jigsaw puzzle imagery task for assessing active visuospatial processes in old and young people,2002,"Recent studies have suggested a theoretical distinction between active elaboration and passive storage in visuospatial working memory, but research with older adults has failed to demonstrate a differential preservation of these two abilities. The results are controversial, and the investigation of the active component has been inhibited by the absence of any appropriate experimental procedures. A new task was developed involving the mental reconstruction of pictures of objects from fragmented pieces, and this provides a useful procedure for exploring active visuospatial processing. Significant differences in terms of both correctness and response latency were obtained between young and older adults and between younger old and older old adults. Performance also varied with visual complexity, mental rotation, and processing load. It is concluded that this ecologically relevant procedure constitutes a very powerful, sensitive, and reliable tool for identifying individual differences in visuospatial working memory."
Virginia BlankenshipAndrew L. Zoota,"Behavior Research Methods, Instruments, & Computers",comparing power imagery in tats written by hand or on the computer,1998,"Two barriers to the use of the Thematic Apperception Test (TAT) in motivation research were addressed: its low internal consistency and its time-consuming coding system. Sixty males and 60 females wrote five stories to TAT pictures either on the computer or by hand. Half of each group were timed and half untimed. The writing of stories was guided by four sets of questions, and stories were coded for need for power (n Pow) by the corresponding four paragraphs. Cronbach’s alpha for the five stories was .46; for the 20 paragraphs, Cronbach’s alpha was .65. We conclude that, to the extent that measuring internal consistency is appropriate for a thought-sampling instrument like the TAT, internal consistency should be calculated by paragraphs. Significantly more words were produced in the untimed condition, but n Pow did not differ by gender, hand-written versus computer-written, or timed versus untimed conditions. The five pictures elicited significantly different amounts of n Pow. It is recommended that researchers who give the TAT on the computer use the untimed condition. Suggestions are made for increasing the scoring validity and for using the computer to decrease the time required for human coders."
Valeriy ShafiroBrian Gygi,"Behavior Research Methods, Instruments, & Computers",how to select stimuli for environmental sound research and where to find them,2004,"A major methodological challenge in environmental sound research is to select appropriate stimuli. When an experiment involves a large number of sound sources, making custom recordings or producing sounds live is frequently impractical or, for certain sounds, impossible. Existing databases of environmental sound recordings provide a researcher with a useful alternative. However, finding and selecting suitable sounds in such databases can be difficult because of the great variety of sounds present, poor documentation, questionable recording quality, and required purchasing costs. This article describes a number of practical issues to consider during the stimulus selection process, offers a preliminary compilation of existing resources for obtaining environmental sound recordings, provides some normative perceptual data that can be used as a reference for selecting stimuli and evaluating performance, and lists required characteristics and structural aspects of a research-oriented environmental sound database."
Francesco Di NoceraFabio Ferlazzo,"Behavior Research Methods, Instruments, & Computers",resampling approach to statistical inference bootstrapping from event related potentials data,2000,"We propose the use of the bootstrap resampling technique as a tool to assess the within-subject reliability of experimental modulation effects on event-related potentials (ERPs). The assessment of the within-subject reliability is relevant in all those cases when the subject score is obtained by some estimation procedure, such as averaging. In these cases, possible deviations from the assumptions on which the estimation procedure relies may lead to severely biased results and, consequently, to incorrect functional inferences. In this study, we applied bootstrap analysis to data from an experiment aimed at investigating the relationship between ERPs and memory processes. ERPs were recorded from two groups of subjects engaged in a recognition memory task. During the study phase, subjects in Group A were required to make an orthographic judgment on 160 visually presented words, whereas subjects in Group B were only required to pay attention to the words. During the test phase all subjects were presented with the 160 previously studied words along with 160 new words and were required to decide whether the current word was “old” or “new.” To assess the effect of word imagery value, half of the words had a high imagery value and half a low imagery value. Analyses of variance performed on ERPs showed that an imagery-induced modulation of the old/new effect was evident only for subjects who were not engaged in the orthographic task during the study phase. This result supports the hypothesis that this modulation is due to some aspect of the recognition memory process and not to the stimulus encoding operations that occur during the recognition memory task. However, bootstrap analysis on the same data showed that the old/new effect on ERPs was not reliable for all the subjects. This result suggests that only a cautious inference can be made from these data."

The difficulty lies in the fact that the standardized regression coefficients belonging to regression models that include different sets of covariates do not represent the same parameter, and thus their direct combination is meaningless. In the present study, a new approach called concealed correlations meta-analysis is proposed that allows for using the common information that standardized regression coefficients from different regression models contain to improve the precision of a combined focal standardized regression coefficient estimate. The performance of this new approach was compared with that of two other approaches: (1) carrying out separate meta-analyses for standardized regression coefficients from studies that used the same regression model, and (2) performing a meta-regression on the focal standardized regression coefficients while including an indicator variable as a moderator indicating the regression model to which each standardized regression coefficient belongs. The comparison was done through a simulation study. The results showed that, as expected, the proposed approach led to more accurate estimates of the combined standardized regression coefficients under both random- and fixed-effect models."

James N. MacGregorJ.

Responding to the need for a larger pool of problems of a similar type and of varying level of difficulty, we report an experiment testing the validity of rebuses as insight problems. A rebus combines verbal and visual clues to a common phrase, such as PAINS (“growing pains”). Solving a rebus requires breaking implicit assumptions of normal reading, similar to the restructuring required in insight. We hypothesized that, the more implicit assumptions are involved, the more difficult the solution. The results of a two-part experiment supported the hypothesis, with participants solving more problems involving one assumption than they did problems involving two or more. Also, rebus performance correlated significantly with self-rated insight and with scores on remote associates, but not with general verbal ability. The findings suggest that rebus puzzles may be a useful source of theoretically grounded insight problems."
Drew H. AbneyChristopher T. KelloRamesh Balasubramaniam,Behavior Research Methods,introduction and application of the multiscale coefficient of variation analysis,2017,"Quantifying how patterns of behavior relate across multiple levels of measurement typically requires long time series for reliable parameter estimation. We describe a novel analysis that estimates patterns of variability across multiple scales of analysis suitable for time series of short duration. The multiscale coefficient of variation (MSCV) measures the distance between local coefficient of variation estimates within particular time windows and the overall coefficient of variation across all time samples. We first describe the MSCV analysis and provide an example analytical protocol with corresponding MATLAB implementation and code. Next, we present a simulation study testing the new analysis using time series generated by ARFIMA models that span white noise, short-term and long-term correlations. The MSCV analysis was observed to be sensitive to specific parameters of ARFIMA models varying in the type of temporal structure and time series length. We then apply the MSCV analysis to short time series of speech phrases and musical themes to show commonalities in multiscale structure. The simulation and application studies provide evidence that the MSCV analysis can discriminate between time series varying in multiscale structure and length."

The use of these new technologies for research has not been without challenges, and a recently published psychological study on Facebook has led to a widespread discussion of the ethics of conducting large-scale experiments online. Surprisingly little has been said about the ethics of conducting research using commercial crowdsourcing marketplaces. In this article, I focus on the question of which ethical questions are raised by data collection with crowdsourcing tools. I briefly draw on the implications of Internet research more generally, and then focus on the specific challenges that research with crowdsourcing tools faces. I identify fair pay and the related issue of respect for autonomy, as well as problems with the power dynamic between researcher and participant, which has implications for withdrawal without prejudice, as the major ethical challenges of crowdsourced data. Furthermore, I wish to draw attention to how we can develop a “best practice” for researchers using crowdsourcing tools."
José Magalhães de Oliveira,Behavior Research Methods,statokinesigram normalization method,2017," Stabilometry is a technique that aims to study the body sway of human subjects, employing a force platform. The signal obtained from this technique refers to the position of the foot base ground-reaction vector, known as the center of pressure (CoP). The parameters calculated from the signal are used to quantify the displacement of the CoP over time; there is a large variability, both between and within subjects, which prevents the definition of normative values. The intersubject variability is related to differences between subjects in terms of their anthropometry, in conjunction with their muscle activation patterns (biomechanics); and the intrasubject variability can be caused by a learning effect or fatigue. Age and foot placement on the platform are also known to influence variability. Normalization is the main method used to decrease this variability and to bring distributions of adjusted values into alignment. In 1996, O’Malley proposed three normalization techniques to eliminate the effect of age and anthropometric factors from temporal-distance parameters of gait. These techniques were adopted to normalize the stabilometric signal by some authors. This paper proposes a new method of normalization of stabilometric signals to be applied in balance studies. The method was applied to a data set collected in a previous study, and the results of normalized and nonnormalized signals were compared. The results showed that the new method, if used in a well-designed experiment, can eliminate undesirable correlations between the analyzed parameters and the subjects’ characteristics and show only the experimental conditions’ effects."

A technique was developed to keep the observer-operator masked during the generation of a transformed staircase. The monocular test time of about 8 min, and the success rate—81% for 224 children aged 2–39 months—compare favorably with our experience with the manual two-operator test. For 39 pairs of age-matched children without visual pathology, grating acuities were 0.6 octaves better with the computerized test. The computerized version was used to measure acuity in 120 children who had, according to clinical examination, poorer vision in one eye than in the other. The suspect eyes showed an average of 0.8 octaves poorer grating acuity. The improvements of computerization were realized without loss of the advantages of the manual test."
Denis CousineauScott BrownAndrew Heathcote,"Behavior Research Methods, Instruments, & Computers",fitting distributions using maximum likelihood methods and packages,2004,"The most powerful tests of response time (RT) models often involve the whole shape of the RT distribution, thus avoiding mimicking that can occur at the level of RT means and variances. Nonpara-metric distribution estimation is, in principle, the most appropriate approach, but such estimators are sometimes difficult to obtain. On the other hand, distribution fitting, given an algebraic function, is both easy and compact. We review the general approach to performing distribution fitting with maximum likelihood (ML) and a method based on quantiles (quantile maximum probability, QMP). We show that QMP has both small bias and good efficiency when used with common distribution functions (the ex-Gaussian, Gumbel, lognormal, Wald, and Weibull distributions). In addition, we review some software packages performing ML (PASTIS, QMPE, DISFIT, and MATHEMATICA) and compare their results. In general, the differences between packages have little influence on the optimal solution found, but the form of the distribution function has: Both the lognormal and the Wald distributions have nonlinear dependencies between the parameter estimates that tend to increase the overall bias in parameter recovery and to decrease efficiency. We conclude by laying out a few pointers on how to relate descriptive models of RT to cognitive models of RT.

The method is based on moving the request for honest responding, often included in the introduction to surveys, to the questioning phase of the survey. Over a quarter of Internet survey participants do not read survey instructions, and therefore, instead of asking respondents to answer honestly, they were asked whether they responded honestly. Posing the honesty message in the form of questions on honest responding draws attention to the message, increases the processing of it, and puts subsequent questions in context with the questions on honest responding. In three studies (nStudy I = 475, nStudy II = 1,015, nStudy III = 899), we tested whether presenting the questions on honest responding before questions on desirable and undesirable behavior could increase the honesty of responses, under the assumption that less attribution of desirable behavior and/or admitting to more undesirable behavior could be taken to indicate more honest responses. In all studies the participants who were presented with the questions on honest responding before questions on the target behavior produced, on average, significantly less socially desirable responses, though the effect sizes were small in all cases (Cohen’s d ranging between 0.02 and 0.28 for single items, and from 0.17 to 0.34 for sum scores). The overall findings and the possible mechanisms behind the influence of the questions concerning honest responding on subsequent questions are discussed, and suggestions are made for future research."
Stuart J. GibsonChristopher J.

The term appearance space is used to distinguish this from previous models. Appearance space is a linear vector space that is dimensionally optimal, enables us to model and describe any human facial appearance, and possesses characteristics that are plausible for the representation of psychological face space. Randomly sampling from a multivariate distribution for a location in appearance space produces entirely plausible faces, and manipulation of a small set of defining parameters enables the automatic generation of photo-realistic caricatures. The appearance space model leads us to the new concept of nonlinear caricatures, and we show that the accepted linear method for caricature is only a special case of a more general paradigm. Nonlinear methods are also viable, and we present examples of photographic quality caricatures, using a number of different transformation functions. Results of a simple experiment are presented that suggest that nonlinear transformations can accurately capture key aspects of the caricature effect. Finally, we discuss the relationship between appearance space, caricature, and facial distinctiveness. On the basis of our new theoretical framework, we suggest an experimental approach that can yield new evidence for the plausibility of face space and its ability to explain processes of recognition."

Jonas M. B. HaslbeckLourens J.

While studying the structure of network models has led to many important insights, little attention has been paid to how well they predict observations. This is despite the fact that predictability is crucial for judging the practical relevance of edges: for instance in clinical practice, predictability of a symptom indicates whether an intervention on that symptom through the symptom network is promising. We close this methodological gap by introducing nodewise predictability, which quantifies how well a given node can be predicted by all other nodes it is connected to in the network. In addition, we provide fully reproducible code examples of how to compute and visualize nodewise predictability both for cross-sectional and time series data."

However, a number of questions in this domain, which are difficult to address with the available methodological resources, are still unresolved. We collected semantic transparency scores for 2,861 compound words at the constituent level (i.e., how strongly the overall meaning of a compound word is related to that of each constituent) and analyzed their effects on speeded pronunciation and lexical decision performance for the compound words using the English Lexicon Project (http://elexicon.wustl.edu) data. The results from both tasks indicated that our human-judged semantic transparency ratings for both the first and second constituents play a significant role in compound word processing. Moreover, additional analyses indicated that the human-judged semantic transparency scores at the constituent level accounted for more variance in compound word recognition performance than did either whole-word semantic transparency scores or corpus-based semantic distance scores."

Age-related effects were found over all four tests, especially as age increased from young childhood through adulthood. For several tests and measures (including pToL and pTMT), age-related slowing was found as age increased in adulthood. Together, these findings indicate that the PEBL tests provide valid and versatile new research tools for measuring executive functions."
Tom HeymanSimon De DeyneKeith A. HutchisonGert Storms,Behavior Research Methods,using the speeded word fragment completion task to examine semantic priming,2015,"The present research investigates semantic priming with an adapted version of the word fragment completion task. In this task, which we refer to as the speeded word fragment completion task, participants need to complete words such as lett_ce (lettuce), from which one letter was omitted, as quickly as possible. This paradigm has some interesting qualities in comparison with the traditionally used lexical decision task. That is, it requires no pseudowords, it is more engaging for participants, and most importantly, it allows for a more fine-grained investigation of semantic activation. In two studies, we found that words were completed faster when the preceding trial comprised a semantically related fragment such as tom_to (tomato) than when it comprised an unrelated fragment such as guit_r (guitar). A third experiment involved a lexical decision task, to compare both paradigms. The results showed that the magnitude of the priming effect was similar, but item-level priming effects were inconsistent over tasks. Crucially, the speeded word fragment completion task obtained strong priming effects for highly frequent, central words, such as work, money, and warm, whereas the lexical decision task did not. In a final experiment featuring only short, highly frequent words, the lexical decision task failed to find a priming effect, whereas the fragment completion task did obtain a robust effect. Taken together, these results suggest that the speeded word fragment completion task may prove a viable alternative for examining semantic priming."

This study is about cross-linguistic equivalence which needs to be established before assessing cross-cultural differences in future research. We developed parallel Mandarin and English measures of interpretation bias and attention bias using back-translation and decentering procedures. We assessed task equivalence by administering both sets of measures to 47 bilingual Mandarin-English speakers. Interpretation bias measurement was similar and reliable across language versions, confirming suitability of the Mandarin versions for future cross-cultural research. By contrast, scores on attention bias tasks did not intercorrelate reliably, suggesting that nonverbal stimuli such as pictures or facial expressions of emotion might present better prospects for cross-cultural comparison.

Such effects have been referenced in debates over the nature of semantic representations, but their theoretical import has been limited by the fact that BOI is a fairly coarse measure of sensorimotor experience with words’ referents. In the present study, we collected ratings for 621 words on seven semantic dimensions (graspability, ease of pantomime, number of actions, animacy, size, danger, and usefulness), in order to investigate which attributes are most strongly related to BOI ratings and to lexical–semantic processing. BOI ratings were obtained from previous norming studies (Bennett, Burnett, Siakaluk, & Pexman in Behavior Research Methods, 43, 1100–1109, 2011; Tillotson, Siakaluk, & Pexman in Behavior Research Methods, 40, 1075–1078, 2008), and measures of lexical–semantic processing were obtained from previous behavioral megastudies involving either the semantic categorization task (concrete/abstract decision; Pexman, Heard, Lloyd, & Yap in Behavior Research Methods, 49, 407–417, 2017) or the lexical decision task (Balota et al., Behavior Research Methods, 39, 445–459, 2007). The results showed that the motor dimensions of graspability, ease of pantomime, and number of actions were all related to BOI, and that these dimensions together explained more variance in semantic processing than did the BOI ratings alone. These ratings will be useful for researchers who wish to study how different kinds of bodily interactions influence lexical–semantic processing and cognition."

Neri,"Behavior Research Methods, Instruments, & Computers",validation of a solid state anomaloscope used to assess red green color vision defects,1988,"Solid-state anomaloscopes whose stimuli are derived from light-emitting diodes (LEDs) are simpler and less expensive than conventional anomaloscopes. We have assessed the test-retest reliability and the validity of one solid-state anomaloscope and have obtained normative data for it. Reliability and validity were assessed by classifying 36 color-defective observers into one of five categories defined by degree of defect. When all color defectives were considered, both the validity and reliability of the solid-state anomaloscope were found to be high. The primary stimuli of the solid-state anomaloscope are less well separated in chromaticity space than are those of conventional anomaloscopes, but there is no evidence that this results in the incorrect classification of anomalous trichromats as dichromats. The solid-state anomaloscope appears to be an acceptable alternative to standard anomaloscopes for both research and screening applications."

Searles,"Behavior Research Methods, Instruments, & Computers",psychological performance assessment via interactive voice response systems,1997,"Two experiments examined the feasibility of psychological assessment using interactive voice response (IVR) technology and the potential sensitivity of such assessments to alcohol and fatigue effects. In Experiment 1, 10 subjects performed a 12-min battery of six IVR-administered tasks, Monday through Friday, over 2 weeks. Minimal learning effects were evident during training. Repeated administrations indicated high test-retest reliabilities. In Experiment 2 (double-blind, alcohol/placebo crossover design), 7 subjects were tested every 2 h over a 24-h period during two experimental sessions (peak blood alcohol concentrations =80 mg/dL). Several IVR-administered tasks were sensitive to alcohol impairment, but not as sensitive as laboratory-based measures specifically designed to assess alcohol impairment. Little evidence for fatigue-related impairment was obtained. The results support optimism for the potential to assess psychomotor and cognitive functioning distally via telephony; however, further refinement and validation of the methods are needed."
Jan Eichstaedt,Behavior Research Methods,magnifying effects on visual word recognition a dynamic display for internet based experiments,2005,"A visual presentation procedure is introduced that presents target words followed by a dynamic mask until recognition. This form of stimulus degradation prolongs the word recognition process. Differences in word recognition latencies—which are usually quite small—are magnified, and thus can be more easily observed. The results of two experiments on the Internet with a total of 141 participants establish the task’s ability to magnify differences in word recognition latencies stemming from word familiarity (Experiment 1) and word prototypicality (Experiment 2). Both factors interact with stimulus degradation, but at different presentation intervals; these results are discussed as evidence for comparing models of word recognition. The new procedure can be used for assessing individual differences, such as implicit motives and self-focused attention. Further applications are discussed."
Seth FreyKarsten DonnayDirk HelbingRobert W. SumnerMaarten W. Bos,Behavior Research Methods,the rippling dynamics of valenced messages in naturalistic youth chat,2019,"Even though human behavior is largely driven by real-time feedback from others, this social complexity is underrepresented in psychological theory, largely because it is so difficult to isolate. In this work, we performed a quasi-experimental analysis of hundreds of millions of chat room messages between young people. This allowed us to reconstruct how—and on what timeline—the valence of one message affects the valence of subsequent messages by others. For the highly emotionally valenced chat messages that we focused on, we found that these messages elicited a general increase of 0.1 to 0.4 messages per minute. This influence started 2 s after the original message and continued out to 60 s. Expanding our focus to include feedback loops—the way a speaker’s chat comes back to affect him or her—we found that the stimulating effects of these same chat events started rippling back from others 8 s after the original message, to cause an increase in the speaker’s chat that persisted for up to 8 min. This feedback accounted for at least 1% of the bulk of chat. Additionally, a message’s valence affects its dynamics, with negative events feeding back more slowly and continuing to affect the speaker longer. By reconstructing the second-by-second dynamics of many psychosocial processes in aggregate, we captured the timescales at which they collectively ripple through a social system to drive system-level outcomes."

Gabriel RecchiaMichael N.

These measures are useful for experimental stimulus selection and for evaluating a model’s cognitive plausibility as a mechanism that people might use to organize meaning in memory. Although humans are exposed to enormous quantities of speech, practical constraints limit the amount of data that many current computational models can learn from. We follow up on previous work evaluating a simple metric of pointwise mutual information. Controlling for confounds in previous work, we demonstrate that this metric benefits from training on extremely large amounts of data and correlates more closely with human semantic similarity ratings than do publicly available implementations of several more complex models. We also present a simple tool for building simple and scalable models from large corpora quickly and efficiently."

Ratings are reported for each face separately. Further analyses showed that the age groups differed in their ratings of young and old faces. On average, old participants evaluated the faces as more positive (i.e., more attractive, more energetic) than did young participants. In line with research on a negative aging stereotype, old faces were judged as less positive than young faces. They were, for instance, seen as less attractive, less likeable, less distinctive, less growth-oriented, and less energetic. The findings of the present study can serve as a basis for the selection of appropriate facial stimuli in age-comparative studies of face perception, face processing, or memory for faces.

Miron ZuckermanMarylène GagnéIris NafshiC. Raymond KneeSuzanne C. Kieffer,"Behavior Research Methods, Instruments, & Computers",testing discrepancy effects a critique a suggestion and an illustration,2002,"To assess the effects of discrepancy between two independent variables, investigators sometimes compute difference scores and correlate such scores with a criterion variable. However, the correlation of the difference with the criterion is accounted for by the correlations of the difference constituents with the criterion and the constituents’ variances. It follows that when investigators are testing a prediction that is not captured by the difference constituents’ main effects, using the difference correlation analysis may be misleading. Under these circumstances, the effects of a discrepancy between two independent variables can be assessed by a test of their interaction. The problems inherent in using difference scores and the advantage of testing the interaction are illustrated in relation to research programs on two separate topics in social psychology."

Stereomotion thresholds for a rectangle oscillating in depth were determined with the use of a dual randomly interleaved staircase design. In a group of 31 naive observers, the average thresholds of 5.97′ of arc forcrossed stereomotion and 6.00′ of arc foruncrossed stereomotion were comparable to those assessed in earlier work done with optics-based techniques. By assessing the thresholds for a rectangle that was defined either by lateral motion or by changing size, in a group of experienced observers, we were able to show that any potential residual translational motion present in the display would not have influenced the stereomotion thresholds. Our findings suggest that this computer-graphics-based technique may be a reasonable alternative to optics-based methods of assessing stereomotion thresholds."

Gs and WM tasks are often repetitive and are often rigidly presented, however. The effects of Gs and WM may, therefore, be confounded with those of motivation and anxiety. In an effort to address this problem, we assessed the concurrent and predictive validity of computer-game-like tests of Gs (Space Code) and WM (Space Matrix) across two experiments. In Experiment 1, within a university sample (N =70), Space Matrix exhibited concurrent validity as a WM measure, whereas Space Code appeared to be a mixed-ability measure. In Experiment 2, Space Matrix exhibited concurrent validity as well as predictive validity (as a predictor of school grades) within a school-aged sample (N=94), but the results for Space Code were less encouraging. Relationships between computer-game-like tests and gender, handedness, and computergame experience are also discussed."
Naomi P.

More continuous measures, such as the total number of words recalled or the proportion of words per set averaged across all sets, were more normally distributed, had higher reliability, and had higher correlations with criterion measures (reading comprehension and Verbal SAT) than did traditional span scores that quantified the highest set size completed or the number of words in correct sets. Furthermore, creation of arbitrary groups (e.g., high-span and low-span groups) led to poor reliability and greatly reduced predictive power. It is recommended that researchers score span tasks with continuous measures and avoid post hoc dichotomization of working memory span groups."

Statistically significant main effects were found for task type—steeper discounting was observed in the binary-choice task— but not for mode of administration. As simple evidence of validity, hyperbolic curves consistently provided a better fit to the data than did exponential curves for both tasks. Further, magnitude effects were also observed across conditions. Correlational results varied largely as a function of the discounting index (either k or area under the curve) under consideration. Across the two tasks, discounting indices showed modest levels of reliability [r(AUC)=.33; r(k)=.75]. The findings pointed to refinements for both the methodology and criteria that are used to study delay discounting and raised questions about the commonly assumed relationship between discounting and the construct of impulsivity."
Taleen NalabandianMolly E. Ireland,Behavior Research Methods,genre typical narrative arcs in films are less appealing to lay audiences and professional film critics,2019,"People tend to like stimuli—ranging from human faces to text—that are prototypical, and thus easily processed. However, recent research has suggested that less typical stimuli may be preferred in creative contexts, such as fine art or music lyrics. In an archival sample of movie scripts, we tested whether genre-typicality predicted film ratings as a function of rater role (novice audience member or expert film critic). Genre-typicality was operationalized as the profile correlations between linguistic arcs (across five segments, or acts) for each script and within-genre averages. We predicted (1) that critics would prefer more disfluent (genre-atypical) films and general audiences would prefer fluent (genre-typical) films, and (2) that these differences would be most pronounced for genres expected to be more entertaining (e.g., action/adventure) than challenging (e.g., tragedy). Partly consistent with our hypotheses, the results showed that critics gave higher ratings to action/adventure films with less typical positive emotion arcs. However, regardless of audience-member or professional-critic status, higher ratings were attributed to films that were more genre-atypical (or disfluent), in terms of analytic thinking, narrative action, and emotional tone, across all genres except family/kids films. Such findings support the growing literature on the appeal of disfluency in the arts and have relevance for researchers in psychology and computer science who are interested in computational linguistic approaches to attitudes, film, and literature."

OLDEYE identifies six types of fixations and calculates descriptive statistics on each of them, on their associated saccades, and on their average pupil diameter. CONVRT represents the text as a string of words that can be coded according to experimentally relevant variables. PLTFIX prints fixation durations by letter position and sequence of occurrence. MODDAT is an interactive program for marking parts of the text in which the data quality is below acceptable standards. It also allows the correction of systematic errors due to calibration or drift. MATCH combines the outputs from OLDEYE, CONVRT, and MODDAT and calculates 11 dependent measures for every word. The output of MATCH is suitable for input to conventional multivariate statistical programs."

In a Monte Carlo study, the efficiency and bias of parameter estimates were examined. Results indicated that samples of at least 400 are necessary to obtain adequate estimates of the ex-Wald and that, for some parameter ranges, much larger samples may be required. For shifted Wald estimation, smaller samples of around 100 were adequate, at least when fits identified by the software as having ill-conditioned maximums were excluded.

We present a new method through which an estimation of the full-CDI score can be obtained, by combining parental responses on a limited set of words sampled randomly from the full CDI with vocabulary information extracted from the WordBank database, sampled from age-, gender-, and language-matched participants. Real-data simulations using versions of the CDI-WS for American English, German, and Norwegian as examples revealed the high validity and reliability of the instrument, even for tests having just 25 words, effectively cutting administration time to a couple of minutes.

Some, but not all, of the integrals appearing in the model’s equations have closed-form solutions, and thus we can avoid computationally expensive numerical approximations. Depending on the number of quadrature nodes used for the remaining numerical integrations, the final algorithm is at least 10 times faster than a classical algorithm using only numerical integration, and the accuracy is slightly higher. Next, we discuss some special cases with an alternative distribution for the residual reaction time or with fewer than three parameters exhibiting trialto-trial variability."

Jamie ReillyAlexandra KellySeung Hwan KimSavannah JettBonnie Zuckerman,Behavior Research Methods,the human task evoked pupillary response function is linear implications for baseline response scaling in pupillometry,2019,"The human task-evoked pupillary response provides a sensitive physiological index of the intensity and online resource demands of numerous cognitive processes (e.g., memory retrieval, problem solving, or target detection). Cognitive pupillometry is a well-established technique that relies upon precise measurement of these subtle response functions. Baseline variability of pupil diameter is a complex artifact that typically necessitates mathematical correction. A methodological paradox within pupillometry is that linear and nonlinear forms of baseline scaling both remain accepted baseline correction techniques, despite yielding highly disparate results. The task-evoked pupillary response (TEPR) could potentially scale nonlinearly, similar to autonomic functions such as heart rate, in which the amplitude of an evoked response diminishes as the baseline rises. Alternatively, the TEPR could scale similarly to the cortical hemodynamic response, as a linear function that is independent of its baseline. However, the TEPR cannot scale both linearly and nonlinearly. Our aim was to adjudicate between linear and nonlinear scaling of human TEPR. We manipulated baseline pupil size by modulating the illuminance in the testing room as participants heard abrupt pure-tone transitions (Exp. 1) or visually monitored word lists (Exp. 2). Phasic pupillary responses scaled according to a linear function across all lighting (dark, mid, bright) and task (tones, words) conditions, demonstrating that the TEPR is independent of its baseline amplitude. We discuss methodological implications and identify a need to reevaluate past pupillometry studies."

This study used a four-group randomized cluster trial design in which teachers were assigned randomly to one of four groups: a “business as usual” control group, a partial intervention group that was provided with access to diagnostic tests results, a partial intervention group that was provided with access to the learning activities, and a full intervention group that was given access to the test results and learning activities. Data were collected from 905 students (6th–12th grade) nested within 44 teachers.

Despite technological and methodological advances in cardiovascular science, the analysis and evaluation of phasic changes in heart rate persists as a way to assess numerous psychological concomitants. Some researchers, however, have pointed to constraints on data analysis when evaluating cardiac activity indexed by heart rate or heart period. Thus, an off-line application toolkit for heart rate analysis is presented. The program, written with National Instruments’ LabVIEW, incorporates a variety of tools for off-line extraction and analysis of heart rate data. Current methods and issues concerning heart rate analysis are highlighted, and how the toolkit provides a flexible environment to ameliorate common problems that typically lead to trial rejection is discussed.

Matthew S. FritzDavid P. MacKinnon,Behavior Research Methods,a graphical representation of the mediated effect,2008,"Mediation analysis is widely used in the social sciences. Despite the popularity of mediation models, few researchers have used graphical methods, other than structural path diagrams, to represent their models. Plots of the mediated effect can help a researcher better understand the results of the analysis and convey these results to others. This article presents a method for creating and interpreting plots of the mediated effect for a variety of mediation models, including models with (1) a dichotomous independent variable, (2) a continuous independent variable, and (3) an interaction between an independent variable and the mediating variable. An empirical example is then presented to illustrate these plots.

The method included video-recorded scenes of real environments, with target words superimposed over the scenes. In Experiment 1, we used a within-subjects manipulation of video contexts and compared the effects of reinstatement of a global context (15 words per context) with effects of less overloaded context cues (1 and 3 words per context) on recall. The size of the reinstatement effects in Experiment 1 show how potently video contexts can cue recall. A strong effect of cue overload was also found; reinstatement effects were smaller, but still quite robust, in the 15 words per context condition. The powerful reinstatement effect was replicated for local contexts in Experiment 2, which included a nocontexts-reinstated group, a control condition used to determine whether reinstatement of half of the cues caused biased output interference for uncued targets. The video context method is a potent way to investigate context-dependent memory."

Complete self-feeding required only 3-6 days for animals started at birth. Once under a self-feeding Schedule, operant responses were shaped to study visual perception, visually guided motor performance, and discrimination learning at ages much younger than those allowed by most alternative methods. Dark rearing, with the only source of visual input being through the face mask eyeholes, allowed the E to control completely the neonate’s visual experiences and its opportunities for visual-motor responding.

Czarnolewski,Behavior Research Methods,research design issues for the use of magnetic resonance imaging machines in brain studies of psychologicalpsychiatric variables,2009,"The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) machine itself has an impact on the likelihood of obtaining successful measurements of brain size in certain groups of subjects. The differential selection and attrition in both cross-sectional and longitudinal designs, therefore, indicate that the MRI coincidentally serves as a screen for the anatomical structure of the brains that are successfully scanned. This screening effect introduces confounds in experiments whose very hypotheses are focused on comparing anatomical differences in subjects who differ, for example, in their reactions to anxiety-inducing situations. Here, behavioral interventions and possible statistical models are presented in order to reduce attrition and other effects of the confounds introduced by the MRI measurement process in research. Child and adolescent research—particularly in the attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder research area—is used as an example to clarify and delineate the general research principles presented in the present article."
Alexa I. RuppertsbergMarina Bloj,Behavior Research Methods,creating physically accurate visual stimuli for free spectral rendering with radiance,2008,"Visual psychophysicists, who study object, color, and light perception, have a demand for software that produces complex but, at the same time, physically accurate stimuli for their experiments. The number of computer graphic packages that simulate the physical interaction of light and surfaces is limited, and mostly they require the purchase of a license. RADIANCE (Ward, 1994), however, is freely available and popular in the visual perception community, making it a prime candidate. We have shown previously that RADIANCE’S simulation accuracy is greatly improved when color is coded by spectra, rather than by the originally envisaged RGB triplets (Ruppertsberg & Bloj, 2006). Here, we present a method for spectral rendering with RADIANCE to generate hyperspectral images that can be converted to XYZ images (CIE 1931 system) and then to machine-dependent RGB images. Generating XYZ stimuli has the added advantage of making stimulus images independent of display devices and, thereby, facilitating the process of reproducing results across different labs.

Confirmatory factor analysis using a structural equations approach was used to develop three scales. The scales were found to demonstrate satisfactory psychometric properties. The reliability coefficients for these scales were as follows: .85 for computer self-efficacy; .88 for work-related outcome expectancy; and .89 for personal outcome expectancy. The scales provide a strong foundation from which to refine the measurement of computer self-efficacy and outcome expectancy.

Shelton,"Behavior Research Methods, Instruments, & Computers",remembering computer command names effects of subject generation versus experimenter imposition,1986,"Two experiments analyzed the effectiveness of goal statements in aiding recall of self-generated as opposed to experimenter-imposed command names. Subjects were presented with a series of before-after pairs representing the computer states before and after a command was executed. In Experiment 1, during study, one group of subjects generated a command name in response to each pair; a second group generated a goal statement describing the goal to be accomplished in addition to generating a command name. During recall, half of each group was required to recall the name, whereas the other half was required to describe the goal before attempting to recall the name. In Experiment 2, during study, command names (and goals for those subjects in the goal condition) were imposed by the experimenter rather than generated by the subject. Subjects who generated goals and names recalled more command names than did those who generated only names or who received imposed goals and/or names. Generation of an appropriate goal at study improved encoding by helping subjects to select more appropriate command names; generation of an appropriate goal at test improved retrieval for appropriate names only, presumably by activating a relevant subset of names. Even in the relatively simple task of naming and remembering command names, having an appropriate model of the domain through the use of specific goal statements substantially improved performance."
Lael J. SchoolerRichard M. Shiffrin,Behavior Research Methods,efficiently measuring recognition performance with sparse data,2005,"We examine methods for measuring performance in signal-detection-like tasks when each participant provides only a few observations. Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate that standard statistical techniques applied to ad’ analysis can lead to large numbers of Type I errors (incorrectly rejecting a hypothesis of no difference). Various statistical methods were compared in terms of their Type I and Type II error (incorrectly accepting a hypothesis of no difference) rates. Our conclusions are the same whether these two types of errors are weighted equally or Type I errors are weighted more heavily. The most promising method is to combine an aggregated’ measure with a percentile bootstrap confidence interval, a computerintensive nonparametric method of statistical inference. Researchers who prefer statistical techniques more commonly used in psychology, such as a repeated measurest test, should useγ (Goodman & Kruskal, 1954), since it performs slightly better than or nearly as well asd’. In general, when repeated measurest tests are used,γ is more conservative thand’: It makes more Type II errors, but its Type I error rate tends to be much closer to that of the traditional .05 α level. It is somewhat surprising thatγ performs as well as it does, given that the simulations that generated the hypothetical data conformed completely to thed’ model. Analyses in which H—FA was used had the highest Type I error rates. Detailed simulation results can be downloaded fromwww.psychonomic.org/archive/Schooler-BRM-2004.zip."

This makes it difficult to compare results between groups and to create normative data sets for any specific navigational task. Such norms, however, are prerequisites for the use of navigation assessments as diagnostic tools—for example, to support the early and differential diagnosis of atypical aging. Here we start addressing these problems by presenting and evaluating a new navigation test suite that we make freely available to other researchers (https://osf.io/mx52y/). Specifically, we designed three navigational tasks, which are adaptations of earlier published tasks used to study the effects of typical and atypical aging on navigation: a route-repetition task that can be solved using egocentric navigation strategies, and route-retracing and directional-approach tasks that both require allocentric spatial processing. Despite introducing a number of changes to the original tasks to make them look more realistic and ecologically valid, and therefore easy to explain to people unfamiliar with a VE or who have cognitive impairments, we replicated the findings from the original studies. Specifically, we found general age-related declines in navigation performance and additional specific difficulties in tasks that required allocentric processes. These findings demonstrate that our new tasks have task demands similar to those of the original tasks, and are thus suited to be used more widely."

We provide photographs and instructions for conducting two brief demonstrations of the phenomenon and provide materials for a related class experiment on the journal’s World-Wide Web site.

This online version collects data on the floor and ceiling of a subject’s span capacity, rather than generating a rough estimate of capacity based on a 50% success rate, as the traditional version does. We compared the two versions within adult subjects in two cohorts: college-age normal readers and college-age reading-disabled readers. To explore the reliability of the online version as a research tool, we employed the Bland-Altman approach to examine agreement between instruments. The online version yielded spans similar to those yielded by the traditional version, tending toward smaller values at the high end and larger values at the low end of span sizes, in the typical readers. It differentiated between the better and poorer readers reliably, and to the same extent as does the verbal version. The online version of the digit span task is comparable to the traditional version in assessing verbal span capacity; the code with which to implement the task is available at www.psychonomic.org/archive."
Ian WalkerSarah Milne,Behavior Research Methods,exploring function estimators as an alternative to regression in psychology,2005,"Most forms of regression analysis make assumptions about the relationships between the variables being modeled. As a consequence, it can be difficult to know which form of analysis is most appropriate for a given data set. In this article, we explore the idea that function estimators might provide a better alternative in many situations. Function estimators discover the best function to link dependent and independent variables, no matter what form this takes. Four studies demonstrate that one type of function estimator (a neural network) not only performs the same tasks as linear regression and nonlinear regression, but often performs these tasks better and with more flexibility. Moreover, neural networks allow a useful secondary analysis in which useful groups of people can be identified. We recommend that function estimators be used in preference to regression-based techniques for many analyses.

Model fits and assumptions were found to be reliable and accurately reflected improvement with training for decision time, although neither search nor decision components of the model individually showed a significant effect of age. The decision component of the model showed larger improvement with training than did the search component, and stopping-time policy accurately reflected the improvements found between ages and within training levels.

Two studies assessing the viability of a computer game-like test of cognitive processing speed are described. In Experiment 1, a computerized coding task that uses a mouse response method (McPherson & Burns, 2005) was the basis for a simple computer game-like test. In Experiment 2, dynamic game-like elements were added. Validity was assessed within a factor analytic framework using standardized abilities tests as marker tests. We conclude that computer game-like tests of processing speed may provide an alternative or supplementary tool for research and assessment. There is clearly potential to develop game-like tests for other cognitive abilities."

This paper provides an overview of a project designed to provide a careful characterization of what “life” is like in LambdaMOO—a classic social MUD—for most, or at least many, members. A “convergent-methodologies” approach embracing qualitative and quantitative, subjective and objective methods was used to generate a large and rich database on this on-line community in terms of four general categories: (1) users and use, (2) sociality, (3) identity, and (4) spatiality. The evidence thus far appears to debunk some of the more provocative claims of widespread MUD addiction and rampant identity fragmentation on line. While supporting the primary importance of sociality in the MUD, the results also demonstrate the strong prevalence of personal, one-on-one social interactions over larger social gatherings. Finally, some close correspondences between patterns of spatial behavior and spatial cognition “in real life” and in LambdaMOO were found."
William RosengrenMarcus NyströmBjörn HammarMartin Stridh,Behavior Research Methods,a robust method for calibration of eye tracking data recorded during nystagmus,2019,"Eye tracking is a useful tool when studying the oscillatory eye movements associated with nystagmus. However, this oscillatory nature of nystagmus is problematic during calibration since it introduces uncertainty about where the person is actually looking. This renders comparisons between separate recordings unreliable. Still, the influence of the calibration protocol on eye movement data from people with nystagmus has not been thoroughly investigated. In this work, we propose a calibration method using Procrustes analysis in combination with an outlier correction algorithm, which is based on a model of the calibration data and on the geometry of the experimental setup. The proposed method is compared to previously used calibration polynomials in terms of accuracy, calibration plane distortion and waveform robustness. Six recordings of calibration data, validation data and optokinetic nystagmus data from people with nystagmus and seven recordings from a control group were included in the study. Fixation errors during the recording of calibration data from the healthy participants were introduced, simulating fixation errors caused by the oscillatory movements found in nystagmus data. The outlier correction algorithm improved the accuracy for all tested calibration methods. The accuracy and calibration plane distortion performance of the Procrustes analysis calibration method were similar to the top performing mapping functions for the simulated fixation errors. The performance in terms of waveform robustness was superior for the Procrustes analysis calibration compared to the other calibration methods. The overall performance of the Procrustes calibration methods was best for the datasets containing errors during the calibration."

Estimation can be performed using either the standard continuous maximum likelihood (CML) method or quantile maximum probability (QMP; Heathcote & Brown, in press). We review the properties of each distribution and the theoretical evidence showing that CML estimates fail for some cases with shifted distributions, whereas QMP estimates do not. In cases in which CML does not fail, a Monte Carlo investigation showed that QMP estimates were usually as good, and in some cases better, than CML estimates. However, the Monte Carlo study also uncovered problems that can occur with both CML and QMP estimates, particularly when samples are small and skew is low, highlighting the difficulties of estimating distributions with parameter-dependent lower bounds."

Participants trained on SF or RSF for 10 sets of eight 3-min practice trials and two 3-min test trials. They then took tests involving retention, resistance to secondary task interference, and transfer to a different control system. They then switched from SF to RSF or from RSF to SF for 2 sets of final tests and completed rating scales comparing RSF and SF. Slight differences were predicted on the basis of a scoring error in the original version of SF used and on slightly more precise joystick control in RSF. The predictions were supported. The SF group started better but did worse when they transferred to RSF. Despite the disadvantage of having to be cautious in generalizing from RSF to SF, we conclude that RSF has many advantages, which include accommodating new PC hardware and new training techniques.

Donald R. WilliamsDaniel R. ZimprichPhilippe Rast,Behavior Research Methods,a bayesian nonlinear mixed effects location scale model for learning,2019,"We present a Bayesian nonlinear mixed-effects location scale model (NL-MELSM). The NL-MELSM allows for fitting nonlinear functions to the location, or individual means, and the scale, or within-person variance. Specifically, in the context of learning, this model allows the within-person variance to follow a nonlinear trajectory, where it can be determined whether variability reduces during learning. It incorporates a sub-model that can predict nonlinear parameters for both the location and scale. This specification estimates random effects for all nonlinear location and scale parameters that are drawn from a common multivariate distribution. This allows estimation of covariances among the random effects, within and across the location and the scale. These covariances offer new insights into the interplay between individual mean structures and intra-individual variability in nonlinear parameters. We take a fully Bayesian approach, not only for ease of estimation but also for inference because it provides the necessary and consistent information for use in psychological applications, such as model selection and hypothesis testing. To illustrate the model, we use data from 333 individuals, consisting of three age groups, who participated in five learning trials that assessed verbal memory. In an exploratory context, we demonstrate that fitting a nonlinear function to the within-person variance, and allowing for individual variation therein, improves predictive accuracy compared to customary modeling techniques (e.g., assuming constant variance). We conclude by discussing the usefulness, limitations, and future directions of the NL-MELSM."

Ronald E. Anderson,Behavior Research Methods & Instrumentation,technical standards and performance standards in the pursuit of quality,1976,"The concept of standards lacks clarity because it is applied both to concrete specifications and to the assessment of quality. Confusion is reduced by introducing the notion of interchange expectancy. distinguishing transfer, coupling, and market success as components. Transfer expectancy depends upon the products to be transported or exchanged, but when there is a need to estimate transfer expectancy, a combination of technical standards and performance standards must be applied. Though performance standards are intended to produce quality, the quality of the instrumentation to measure performance standards is often neglected. The development of high-quality performance standards first requires the delineation of the relevant dimensions of performance quality. The process of giving precision to performance standards may lead to the emergence of more acceptable technical standards. To illustrate some of these points, data is presented from the CONDUIT system for quality evaluation of computer-based curriculum materials. The performance quality of these products includes the dimension of transfer expectancy, as well as educational and scientific merit. Increased specification and impact of technical standards may provide greater incentives to authors and hence lead to the invention of products which have higher educational and scientific quality."

Thus, each S in the pair serves as a yoked control for the other, in reciprocal relation to the two CSs used. In addition to eliminating inadvertent confounding stemming from individual differences in sensitization and responsiveness, the reciprocal yoked control design also provides a single-session method for identifying Ss who are equally classically conditionable, so that instrumental-classical comparisons can be made free of bias from differences in classical conditionability. In addition, this design provides a means for testing the empirical soundness of Church’s arguments regarding differences in conditionability and biased outcomes Methods for statistical analysis of the reciprocal yoked control design are also considered."

Clinical categories of body types were used as prototypes. By comparing the subjective appearance of a person’s body with prototypes, we can understand how different attributes of his or her body shape contribute to perception of body size. After lifelike random distortions have been applied to parts of their body image, individuals adjust their body shapes until they converge on their perceived veridical appearance. Exaggeration and minimization of particular body areas measured with respect to their true shape and with different prototypes can be expressed as numerical deviations. In this way, perceived body size and body attractiveness can be appraised during the course of diagnosis and treatment of eating disorders."
Kristopher J. PreacherAndrew F. Hayes,"Behavior Research Methods, Instruments, & Computers",spss and sas procedures for estimating indirect effects in simple mediation models,2004,"Researchers often conduct mediation analysis in order to indirectly assess the effect of a proposed cause on some outcome through a proposed mediator. The utility of mediation analysis stems from its ability to go beyond the merely descriptive to a more functional understanding of the relationships among variables. A necessary component of mediation is a statistically and practically significant indirect effect. Although mediation hypotheses are frequently explored in psychological research, formal significance tests of indirect effects are rarely conducted. After a brief overview of mediation, we argue the importance of directly testing the significance of indirect effects and provide SPSS and SAS macros that facilitate estimation of the indirect effect with a normal theory approach and a bootstrap approach to obtaining confidence intervals, as well as the traditional approach advocated by Baron and Kenny (1986). We hope that this discussion and the macros will enhance the frequency of formal mediation tests in the psychology literature.

José L. Pardo-VázquezJosé Fernández-Rey,Behavior Research Methods,external validation of the computerized group administrable adaptation of the operation span task,2008,"One of the most widely used tasks for measuring working memory capacity is the operation span task (OSPAN; Turner & Engle, 1989). This task has almost always been applied individually, and stimuli presentation is controlled by the experimenter. Recently, De Neys, d’Ydewalle, Schaeken, and Vos (2002) improved the administration procedure by designing an automated, group-administrable version of the task (GOSPAN). They found GOSPAN to be reliable, and they also provided evidence on its validity (a significant positive correlation between GOSPAN and OSPAN scores). However, an external test of GOSPAN validity is still lacking. In this work, we present such a validation for the automated version, when the task is administered both individually (Experiment 1) and to groups (Experiment 2). There are abundant previous data on the relation between working memory capacity and reading comprehension. In this work, this relation is studied using an automated OSPAN version to measure working memory capacity. Given that our results are similar to those found using the original OSPAN, our data support the external validity of the automated version of the task. We also tested the reliability of the task and found high internal consistency in both experiments."

We applied the proposed model to a dataset to compare its performance with traditional DCMs for polytomous items. We also conducted a simulation study based on the applied study condition in order to evaluate the parameter recovery of the proposed model. The findings suggest that the proposed model shows promise for (1) accommodating much smaller sample sizes by reducing a large number of parameters for estimation; (2) obtaining item category response probabilities and individual scores very similar to those from a traditional saturated model; and (3) providing general item information that is not available in traditional DCMs for polytomous items.

GEIS questionnaires were prepared using a common script syntax in all supported modes. Scripted development allowed for rapid interview development without the need for programming. A GEIS script specified the following: question texts, including variable texts; answer option texts; numeric codes for answers; range check information; logical question-branching information; interview status information; do-loop information; and IVR information, such as key codes and voice messages. GEIS thoroughly checked scripts for logical or syntactical errors. GEIS required SAS Version 8.0, and survey data were accumulated within SAS data sets. An application of GEIS to conduct a survey involving CATI, IVR, and a combined hybrid method is described. The CATI results deviated in the direction expected for sensitive questions, whereas IVR obtained a small sample size, rendering the results unreliable.

Antonio SolanasLluís SalafrancaCarles RibaVicenta SierraDavid Leiva,Behavior Research Methods,quantifying social asymmetric structures,2006,"Many social phenomena involve a set of dyadic relations among agents whose actions may be dependent. Although individualistic approaches have frequently been applied to analyze social processes, these are not generally concerned with dyadic relations, nor do they deal with dependency. This article describes a mathematical procedure for analyzing dyadic interactions in a social system. The proposed method consists mainly of decomposing asymmetric data into their symmetric and skew-symmetric parts. A quantification of skew symmetry for a social system can be obtained by dividing the norm of the skew-symmetric matrix by the norm of the asymmetric matrix. This calculation makes available to researchers a quantity related to the amount of dyadic reciprocity. With regard to agents, the procedure enables researchers to identify those whose behavior is asymmetric with respect to all agents. It is also possible to derive symmetric measurements among agents and to use multivariate statistical techniques."
Trefford Lee Simpson,"Behavior Research Methods, Instruments, & Computers",a comparison of six methods to estimate thresholds from psychometric functions,1995,"There are many ways in which to estimate thresholds from psychometric functions. However, almost nothing is known about the relationships between these estimates. In the present experiment, Monte Carlo techniques were used to compare psychometric thresholds obtained using six methods. Three psychometric functions were simulated using Naka-Rushton and Weibull functions and a probit/logit function combination. Thresholds were estimated using probit, logit, and normit analyses and least-squares regressions of untransformed orz-score and logit-transformed probabilities versus stimulus strength. Histograms were derived from 100 thresholds using each of the six methods for various sampling strategies of each psychometric function. Thresholds from probit, logit, and normit analyses were remarkably similar. Thresholds fromz-score- and logit-transformed regressions were more variable, and linear regression produced biased threshold estimates under some circumstances. Considering the similarity of thresholds, the speed of computation, and the ease of implementation, logit and normit analyses provide effective alternatives to the current “gold standard”—probit analysis—for the estimation of psychometric thresholds."

Yin-Yin Sarah TanShane T. Mueller,Behavior Research Methods,adapting cultural mixture modeling for continuous measures of knowledge and memory fluency,2016,"Previous research (e.g., cultural consensus theory (Romney, Weller, & Batchelder, American Anthropologist, 88, 313–338, 1986); cultural mixture modeling (Mueller & Veinott, 2008)) has used overt response patterns (i.e., responses to questionnaires and surveys) to identify whether a group shares a single coherent attitude or belief set. Yet many domains in social science have focused on implicit attitudes that are not apparent in overt responses but still may be detected via response time patterns. We propose a method for modeling response times as a mixture of Gaussians, adapting the strong-consensus model of cultural mixture modeling to model this implicit measure of knowledge strength. We report the results of two behavioral experiments and one simulation experiment that establish the usefulness of the approach, as well as some of the boundary conditions under which distinct groups of shared agreement might be recovered, even when the group identity is not known. The results reveal that the ability to recover and identify shared-belief groups depends on (1) the level of noise in the measurement, (2) the differential signals for strong versus weak attitudes, and (3) the similarity between group attitudes. Consequently, the method shows promise for identifying latent groups among a population whose overt attitudes do not differ, but whose implicit or covert attitudes or knowledge may differ."
Jeff KeithChris WestburyJames Goldman,Behavior Research Methods,performance impact of stop lists and morphological decomposition on wordword corpus based semantic space models,2015,"Corpus-based semantic space models, which primarily rely on lexical co-occurrence statistics, have proven effective in modeling and predicting human behavior in a number of experimental paradigms that explore semantic memory representation. The most widely studied extant models, however, are strongly influenced by orthographic word frequency (e.g., Shaoul & Westbury, Behavior Research Methods, 38, 190–195, 2006). This has the implication that high-frequency closed-class words can potentially bias co-occurrence statistics. Because these closed-class words are purported to carry primarily syntactic, rather than semantic, information, the performance of corpus-based semantic space models may be improved by excluding closed-class words (using stop lists) from co-occurrence statistics, while retaining their syntactic information through other means (e.g., part-of-speech tagging and/or affixes from inflected word forms). Additionally, very little work has been done to explore the effect of employing morphological decomposition on the inflected forms of words in corpora prior to compiling co-occurrence statistics, despite (controversial) evidence that humans perform early morphological decomposition in semantic processing. In this study, we explored the impact of these factors on corpus-based semantic space models. From this study, morphological decomposition appears to significantly improve performance in word–word co-occurrence semantic space models, providing some support for the claim that sublexical information—specifically, word morphology—plays a role in lexical semantic processing. An overall decrease in performance was observed in models employing stop lists (e.g., excluding closed-class words). Furthermore, we found some evidence that weakens the claim that closed-class words supply primarily syntactic information in word–word co-occurrence semantic space models."
Ivan Hernandez,Behavior Research Methods,advances in examining preferences for similarity in seating revisiting the aggregation index,2015,"Past research finds that people prefer to sit next to others who are similar to them in a variety of dimensions such as race, sex, and physical appearance. This preference for similarity in seating arrangements is called aggregation and is most commonly measured with the aggregation index (Campbell, Kruskal, & Wallace, Sociometry 29, 1–15, 1966). The aggregation index compares the observed dissimilarity in seating with the amount of dissimilarity that would be expected if seats were chosen randomly. However, the current closed-form equations for this method limit the ease, flexibility, and inferences that researchers have. This paper presents a new approach for studying aggregation that uses bootstrapped resampling of the seating environment to estimate the aggregation index parameters. This method, compiled as an executable program, SocialAggregation, reads a seating chart matrix provided by the researcher and automatically computes the observed number of dissimilar adjacencies, and simulates random seating preferences. The current method’s estimates not only converge with those of the original method, but it also handles a wider variety of situations and also allows for more precise hypothesis testing by directly modeling the distribution of the seating arrangements. Developing a better measure of aggregation opens new possibilities for understanding intergroup biases, and allows researchers to examine aggregation more efficiently."

Assessing color vision using an easily accessible and portable test may help in the self-monitoring of vision-related changes in ocular/systemic conditions and assist in the early detection of disease processes. Tablet computer-based games were developed with different levels of gamification as a more portable option to assess chromatic contrast sensitivity. Game 1 was designed as a clinical version with no gaming elements. Game 2 was a gamified version of game 1 (added fun elements: feedback, scores, and sounds) and game 3 was a complete game with vision task nested within. The current study aimed to determine the normative values and evaluate repeatability of the tablet computer-based games in comparison with an established test, the Cambridge Colour Test (CCT) Trivector test. Normally sighted individuals [N = 100, median (range) age 19.0 years (18–56 years)] had their chromatic contrast sensitivity evaluated binocularly using the three games and the CCT. Games 1 and 2 and the CCT showed similar absolute thresholds and tolerance intervals, and game 3 had significantly lower values than games 1, 2, and the CCT, due to visual task differences. With the exception of game 3 for blue-yellow, the CCT and tablet computer-based games showed similar repeatability with comparable 95% limits of agreement. The custom-designed games are portable, rapid, and may find application in routine clinical practice, especially for testing younger populations."

This research primarily uses the Life Events Inventory (LEI), listing possible experiences that could have happened during childhood (Garry, Manning, Loftus, & Sherman, Psychonomic Bulletin & Review, 3, 208–214, 1996). Although imagination inflation research has spawned more than 50 investigations, no normative ratings exist on individual items contained in the LEI. To address this, we present descriptive statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, confidence interval) for 124 LEI items on occurrence (how likely is it that this experience happened to you), plausibility (how plausible is it that this event could have happened to someone), and desirability (how desirable is this experience). Occurrence and plausibility showed similar patterns of mean item ratings and were highly correlated, whereas desirability was moderately correlated with plausibility and unrelated to occurrence. These data should facilitate a more informed selection of specific LEI items to use in further research and can assist in clarifying the contributions of normative occurrence, plausibility, and desirability to imagination inflation effects."

Indeed, even if paying one respondent to complete one questionnaire represents a very small cost, the multiplication of botnets providing invalid response sets may ultimately reduce study validity while increasing research costs. Several techniques have been proposed thus far to detect problematic human response sets, but little research has been undertaken to test the extent to which they actually detect nonhuman response sets. Thus, we proposed to conduct an empirical comparison of these indices. Assuming that most botnet programs are based on random uniform distributions of responses, we present and compare seven indices in this study to detect nonhuman response sets. A sample of 1,967 human respondents was mixed with different percentages (i.e., from 5% to 50%) of simulated random response sets. Three of the seven indices (i.e., response coherence, Mahalanobis distance, and person–total correlation) appear to be the best estimators for detecting nonhuman response sets. Given that two of those indices—Mahalanobis distance and person–total correlation—are calculated easily, every researcher working with online questionnaires could use them to screen for the presence of such invalid data."

The two pellets maintained equivalent moderate and high response rates on the single schedules. In the concurrent schedules, 3 out of 4 rats showed a small preference for the Bio-Serv pellets. Although both pellets performed adequately in normal humidity, high humidity caused the Bio-Serv pellets to soften and occasionally to be crushed in the pellet dispenser. Their softness may have been the reason they were preferred. The two pellets can be regarded as generally equivalent, except in high humidity. The only experiments in which they might not be used interchangeably are those involving choices between different reinforcers."

Nathan J. Evans,Behavior Research Methods,a method framework and tutorial for efficiently simulating models of decision making,2019,"Evidence accumulation models (EAMs) have become the dominant models of rapid decision-making. Several variants of these models have been proposed, ranging from the simple linear ballistic accumulator (LBA) to the more complex leaky-competing accumulator (LCA), and further extensions that include time-varying rates of evidence accumulation or decision thresholds. Although applications of the simpler variants have been widespread, applications of the more complex models have been fewer, largely due to their intractable likelihood function and the computational cost of mass simulation. Here, I present a framework for efficiently fitting complex EAMs, which uses a new, efficient method of simulating these models. I find that the majority of simulation time is taken up by random number generation (RNG) from the normal distribution, needed for the stochastic noise of the differential equation. To reduce this inefficiency, I propose using the well-known concept within computer science of “look-up tables” (LUTs) as an approximation to the inverse cumulative density function (iCDF) method of RNG, which I call “LUT-iCDF”. I show that when using an appropriately sized LUT, simulations using LUT-iCDF closely match those from the standard RNG method in R. My framework, which I provide a detailed tutorial on how to implement, includes C code for 12 different variants of EAMs using the LUT-iCDF method, and should make the implementation of complex EAMs easier and faster."

Grammatical complexity is one of the language use characteristics sensitive to the effects of Alzheimer’s disease and is difficult to operationalize and measure using manual approaches. In the current study, we demonstrate the application of computational linguistic methods to automate the analysis of grammatical complexity. We implemented the Computerized Linguistic Analysis System (CLAS) based on the Stanford syntactic parser (Klein and Manning, Pattern Recognition, 38(9), 1407–1419, 2005) for longitudinal analysis of changes in syntactic complexity in language affected by neurodegenerative disorders. We manually validated CLAS scoring and used it to analyze writings of Iris Murdoch, a renowned Irish author diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease. We found clear patterns of decline in grammatical complexity consistent with previous analyses of Murdoch’s writing conducted by Garrard, Maloney, Hodges, and Patterson (Brain, 128(250–260, 2005). CLAS is a fully automated system that may be used to derive objective and reproducible measures of syntactic complexity in language production and can be particularly useful in longitudinal studies with large volumes of language samples."
Chris Hydock,Behavior Research Methods,assessing and overcoming participant dishonesty in online data collection,2018,"Crowdsourcing services, such as MTurk, have opened a large pool of participants to researchers. Unfortunately, it can be difficult to confidently acquire a sample that matches a given demographic, psychographic, or behavioral dimension. This problem exists because little information is known about individual participants and because some participants are motivated to misrepresent their identity with the goal of financial reward. Despite the fact that online workers do not typically display a greater than average level of dishonesty, when researchers overtly request that only a certain population take part in an online study, a nontrivial portion misrepresent their identity. In this study, a proposed system is tested that researchers can use to quickly, fairly, and easily screen participants on any dimension. In contrast to an overt request, the reported system results in significantly fewer (near zero) instances of participant misrepresentation. Tests for misrepresentations were conducted by using a large database of past participant records (~45,000 unique workers). This research presents and tests an important tool for the increasingly prevalent practice of online data collection."

In the present study, we investigated whether LexTALE-type tests also discriminate at the high end of the proficiency range. In several regions of Spain, people speak both the regional language (e.g., Catalan or Basque) and Spanish to very high degrees. Still, because of their living circumstances, some consider themselves as either Spanish-dominant or regional-language dominant. We showed that these two groups perform differently on the recently published Spanish Lextale-Esp: The Spanish-dominant group had significantly higher scores than the Catalan-dominant group. We also showed that the noncognate words of the test have the highest discrimination power. This indicates that the existing Lextale-Esp can be used to estimate proficiency differences in highly proficient bilinguals with Spanish as an L2, and that a more sensitive test could be built by replacing the cognates."

SPaM is a synthesis of self-paced reading and masked priming. The primary purpose of SPaM is to permit the study of sentence context effects on early word recognition. In the experiment reported here, we show that SPaM successfully reproduces results from both the self-paced reading and masked-priming literatures. We also outline the advantages and potential uses of this paradigm. For users of E-Prime, the experimental program can be downloaded from our lab website, http://epl.beckman.illinois.edu/."
Ron D.

A variety of probability-based panels have been created, including Telepanel/CentERpanel, Knowledge Networks (now GFK KnowledgePanel), the American Life Panel, the Longitudinal Internet Studies for the Social Sciences panel, and the Understanding America Study panel. Despite the advantage of having a known denominator (sampling frame), the probability-based Internet panels often have low recruitment participation rates, and some have argued that there is little practical difference between opting out of a probability sample and opting into a nonprobability (convenience) Internet panel. This article provides an overview of both probability-based and convenience panels, discussing potential benefits and cautions for each method, and summarizing the approaches used to weight panel respondents in order to better represent the underlying population. Challenges of using Internet panel data are discussed, including false answers, careless responses, giving the same answer repeatedly, getting multiple surveys from the same respondent, and panelists being members of multiple panels. More is to be learned about Internet panels generally and about Web-based data collection, as well as how to evaluate data collected using mobile devices and social-media platforms."

Maynard,Behavior Research Methods,an integrated ball projection technology for the study of dynamic interceptive actions,2014,"Dynamic interceptive actions, such as catching or hitting a ball, are important task vehicles for investigating the complex relationship between cognition, perception, and action in performance environments. Representative experimental designs have become more important recently, highlighting the need for research methods to ensure that the coupling of information and movement is faithfully maintained. However, retaining representative design while ensuring systematic control of experimental variables is challenging, due to the traditional tendency to employ methods that typically involve use of reductionist motor responses such as buttonpressing or micromovements. Here, we outline the methodology behind a custom-built, integrated ball projection technology that allows images of advanced visual information to be synchronized with ball projection. This integrated technology supports the controlled presentation of visual information to participants while they perform dynamic interceptive actions. We discuss theoretical ideas behind the integration of hardware and software, along with practical issues resolved in technological design, and emphasize how the system can be integrated with emerging developments such as mixed reality environments. We conclude by considering future developments and applications of the integrated projection technology for research in human movement behaviors."
Alexandra PaxtonThomas L. Griffiths,Behavior Research Methods,finding the traces of behavioral and cognitive processes in big data and naturally occurring datasets,2017,"Today, people generate and store more data than ever before as they interact with both real and virtual environments. These digital traces of behavior and cognition offer cognitive scientists and psychologists an unprecedented opportunity to test theories outside the laboratory. Despite general excitement about big data and naturally occurring datasets among researchers, three “gaps” stand in the way of their wider adoption in theory-driven research: the imagination gap, the skills gap, and the culture gap. We outline an approach to bridging these three gaps while respecting our responsibilities to the public as participants in and consumers of the resulting research. To that end, we introduce Data on the Mind (http://www.dataonthemind.org), a community-focused initiative aimed at meeting the unprecedented challenges and opportunities of theory-driven research with big data and naturally occurring datasets. We argue that big data and naturally occurring datasets are most powerfully used to supplement—not supplant—traditional experimental paradigms in order to understand human behavior and cognition, and we highlight emerging ethical issues related to the collection, sharing, and use of these powerful datasets."

In results based on data collected from 186 university students, the entropy of the R-ASCM mostly loads the first principal component extracted from the CFIT subtests and shows a corresponding strong relationship with the item difficulty of the R-ASCM. Because entropy is a ratio scale of complexity&#x2014; with a true zero and units called bits&#x2014;these findings suggest that entropy is the right vehicle for measuring the information contained in nonverbal intelligence tests."

To estimate the parameters of both models, the program uses a CML approach. The model parameters can also be estimated with a MML approach that can be implemented in PROC NLMIXED of SAS Version 8. Both the MIRID CML program and the MML SAS approach are explained and compared in a simulation study. The results showed that they did about equally well in estimating the values of the item parameters but that there were some differences in the estimation of the person parameters, as could be expected from the differential assumptions regarding the distribution of the persons. The SAS MML approach is much slower than the MIRID CML program, but it is more flexible."

Imageability ratings are used extensively in psycholinguistic, neuropsychological, and aphasiological studies. However, little formal knowledge exists about whether and how these ratings are associated between and within languages. Fifteen imageability databases were cross-correlated using nonparametric statistics. Some of these corresponded to unpublished data collected within a European research network—the Collaboration of Aphasia Trialists (COST IS1208). All but four of the correlations were significant. The average strength of the correlations (rho = .68) and the variance explained (R 2 = 46%) were moderate. This implies that factors other than imageability may explain 54% of the results. Imageability ratings often correlate across languages. Different possibly interacting factors may explain the moderate strength and variance explained in the correlations: (1) linguistic and cultural factors; (2) intrinsic differences between the databases; (3) range effects; (4) small numbers of words in each database, equivalent words, and participants; and (5) mean age of the participants. The results suggest that imageability ratings may be used cross-linguistically. However, further understanding of the factors explaining the variance in the correlations will be needed before research and practical recommendations can be made."

The emotional transformations can be applied to any audio file, but can also run in real time, using live input from a microphone, with less than 20-ms latency. We anticipate that this tool will be useful for the study of emotions in psychology and neuroscience, because it enables a high level of control over the acoustical and emotional content of experimental stimuli in a variety of laboratory situations, including real-time social situations. We present here results of a series of validation experiments aiming to position the tool against several methodological requirements: that transformed emotions be recognized at above-chance levels, valid in several languages (French, English, Swedish, and Japanese) and with a naturalness comparable to natural speech."

The inclusion of non-vocal stimuli allows the detection of significant dissociations between the two categories (vocal vs. non-vocal stimuli). The distributions of accuracy and sensitivity scores (d’) reflected a wide range of individual differences in voice recognition performance in the population. As expected, KH showed a dissociation between the recognition of voices and bell sounds, her performance being significantly poorer than matched controls for voices but not for bells. By providing normative data of a large sample and by testing a developmental phonagnosic subject, we demonstrated that the Glasgow Voice Memory Test, available online and accessible from all over the world, can be a valid screening tool (~5 min) for a preliminary detection of potential cases of phonagnosia and of “super recognizers” for voices."

Participants (n = 193) were instructed to say a verb upon seeing a noun displayed on a computer screen and were cued to respond creatively to half of the nouns. For every noun–verb pair (72 pairs per subject), we assessed the semantic distance between the noun and the verb, using latent semantic analysis (LSA). Semantic distance was higher in the cued (""creative"") condition than the uncued condition, within subjects. Critically, between subjects, semantic distance in the cued condition had a strong relationship to a creativity factor derived from a battery of verbal, nonverbal, and achievement-based creativity measures (β= .50), and this relation remained when controlling for intelligence and personality. The data show that creative cognition can be assessed reliably and validly from such thin slices of behavior."
Raimondas ZemblysDiederick C.

Moreover, this thresholding is largely left for the end user. Here we present and develop gazeNet, a new framework for creating event detectors that do not require hand-crafted signal features or signal thresholding. It employs an end-to-end deep learning approach, which takes raw eye-tracking data as input and classifies it into fixations, saccades and post-saccadic oscillations. Our method thereby challenges an established tacit assumption that hand-crafted features are necessary in the design of event detection algorithms. The downside of the deep learning approach is that a large amount of training data is required. We therefore first develop a method to augment hand-coded data, so that we can strongly enlarge the data set used for training, minimizing the time spent on manual coding. Using this extended hand-coded data, we train a neural network that produces eye-movement event classification from raw eye-movement data without requiring any predefined feature extraction or post-processing steps. The resulting classification performance is at the level of expert human coders. Moreover, an evaluation of gazeNet on two other datasets showed that gazeNet generalized to data from different eye trackers and consistently outperformed several other event detection algorithms that we tested."

Nia M. M. DowellTristan M. NixonArthur C. Graesser,Behavior Research Methods,group communication analysis a computational linguistics approach for detecting sociocognitive roles in multiparty interactions,2019,"Roles are one of the most important concepts in understanding human sociocognitive behavior. During group interactions, members take on different roles within the discussion. Roles have distinct patterns of behavioral engagement (i.e., active or passive, leading or following), contribution characteristics (i.e., providing new information or echoing given material), and social orientation (i.e., individual or group). Different combinations of roles can produce characteristically different group outcomes, and thus can be either less or more productive with regard to collective goals. In online collaborative-learning environments, this can lead to better or worse learning outcomes for the individual participants. In this study, we propose and validate a novel approach for detecting emergent roles from participants’ contributions and patterns of interaction. Specifically, we developed a group communication analysis (GCA) by combining automated computational linguistic techniques with analyses of the sequential interactions of online group communication. GCA was applied to three large collaborative interaction datasets (participant N = 2,429, group N = 3,598). Cluster analyses and linear mixed-effects modeling were used to assess the validity of the GCA approach and the influence of learner roles on student and group performance. The results indicated that participants’ patterns of linguistic coordination and cohesion are representative of the roles that individuals play in collaborative discussions. More broadly, GCA provides a framework for researchers to explore the micro intra- and interpersonal patterns associated with participants’ roles and the sociocognitive processes related to successful collaboration."

In order to generate spatial models, it is necessary to first obtain empirical similarity data. A number of methods are available for collecting these data, but little effort has been made to compare their relative utility. In this article, we compare directly rated and five feature-based similarity data types in regard to their ability to be adequately represented by a spatial model (representational goodness of fit), and the ability of the representations to predict three external empirical variables (predictive validity). The results indicate that the representational goodness of fit of the feature-based similarities is noticeably superior to the directly rated similarities, and that the predictions of representations derived from common feature similarity data are substantially more likely than the predictions of all of the alternative representations. It is suggested that these findings are highly relevant to researchers employing spatial models to represent conceptual data, given that direct pairwise ratings have generally been considered the “gold standard” means of obtaining empirical similarities."

Here the familiar parametrict test is compared with a test based on sampled permutations. Indices considered are the odds and log odds ratio, Yule’sQ, Wampold’s (1989) transformed kappa, and phi. The odds and log odds ratio are monotonically increasing functions of Yule’sQ and so give similar results. Yule’sQ and phi are essentially rank order invariant and usually give similar results. Transformed kappa, however, rank orders subjects somewhat differently than the others; moreover, it appears somewhat biased. With respect to the tests, when subjects are 20 or more it does not matter much whether sampled permutation or parametrict tests are used; both yield essentially the same result. However, when subjects are fewer than 20, or whenever there is any other reason to think that parametric assumptions may not be met, permutation tests are recommended.

In view of the computational difficulty inherent in implementing QML, we provide open-source Fortran 90 code that calculates QML estimates for parameters of the ex-Gaussian distribution, as well as standard maximum likelihood estimates. We show that parameter estimates from QML are asymptotically unbiased and normally distributed. Our software provides asymptotically correct standard error and parameter intercorrelation estimates, as well as producing the outputs required for constructing quantile—quantile plots. The code is parallelizable and can easily be modified to estimate parameters from other distributions. Compiled binaries, as well as the source code, example analysis files, and a detailed manual, are available for free on the Internet."
Rani GoodacreLisa Zadro,Behavior Research Methods,o cam a new paradigm for investigating the effects of ostracism,2010,"A new ostracism paradigm—O-Cam—was designed to combine the best qualities of both social ostracism (i.e., face-to-face interaction between the target and sources of ostracism) and cyber ostracism (i.e., confederatefree, highly controlled designs) paradigms. O-Cam consists of a simulated Web conference during which participants are either ostracized or included by 2 other participants whose actions, unbeknownst to the participants, are actually pretaped. The findings of preliminary studies indicate that O-Cam provides a powerful ostracism experience that yields psychological and behavioral responses that are consistent with those in other ostracism paradigms (e.g., Cyberball; Williams, 2007). Moreover, unlike in many previous ostracism paradigms, O-Cam provides researchers with the flexibility to manipulate the physical appearance and the verbal/nonbehavior of the sources of ostracism without the need for confederates."
Jeffrey B. Mulligan,"Behavior Research Methods, Instruments, & Computers",image processing for improved eye tracking accuracy,1997,"Video cameras provide a simple, noninvasive method for monitoring a subject’s eye movements. An important concept is that of the resolution of the system, which is the smallest eye movement that can be reliably detected. While hardware systems are available that estimate direction of gaze in real time from a video image of the pupil, such systems must limit image processing to attain real-time performance and are limited to a resolution of about 10 arc minutes. Two ways to improve resolution are discussed. The first is to improve the image processing algorithms that are used to derive an estimate. Offline analysis of the data can improve resolution by at least one order of magnitude for images of the pupil. A second avenue by which to improve resolution is to increase the optical gain of the imaging setup (i.e., the amount of image motion produced by a given eye rotation). Ophthalmoscopic imaging of retinal blood vessels provides increased optical gain and improved immunity to small head movements but requires a highly sensitive camera. The large number of images involved in a typical experiment imposes great demands on the storage, handling, and processing of data. A major bottleneck had been the real-time digitization and storage of large amounts of video imagery, but recent developments in video compression hardware have made this problem tractable at a reasonable cost. Images of both the retina and the pupil can be analyzed successfully using a basic toolbox of image-processing routines (filtering, correlation, thresholding, etc.), which are, for the most part, well suited to implementation on vectorizing supercomputers."

It constructs imaginaryx-, y-, z-coordinates around a moving object by juxtaposing front and side views on one video record. A special effects generator (SEG) superimposes this two-part image onto the microcomputer’s graphic output. The user watches the SEG’s output and traces the motion of interest in real-time with a computer-generated cursor, a process that assesses the onset time, termination time, duration, linear displacement (i.e., length), and velocity of each traced movement. Reliability coefficients between two independent users were .99 for onset time, .85 for duration, .89 for displacement, and .90 for velocity. In 80 gestures, the correlation between estimated displacement and measured displacement was .73; the correlation between estimated duration (determined from frame-by-frame inspection of the videotape) and measured duration was .80. Twenty-five measurements of displacement for a motorized target traveling 75.4 in. differed from the true value by | .06 |, | .06 |, and | .30 | in. for thex, y, andz dimensions, respectively."

As the available resolution of CRT screens increases, it becomes more difficult to measure and correct for this distortion. We present a simple, highly accurate method for determining the mapping between internal coordinates and the viewing plane. It requires that an observer, using a calibration program, adjust triples of displayed points until they are collinear. A metal straightedge placed between the observer and the screen aids in this judgment. We describe the calibration of an IBM Enhanced Graphics Display in high-resolution mode (350 × 640 pixels), and illustrate how to use the estimated mapping to choose internal coordinates to draw undistorted figures that are accurate to within 0.5 pixel. The method can be used to assess or to correct the accuracy of visual displays. The method is relevant to experiments in spatial vision, spatial perception, perception of dot patterns, and any application in which geometrically accurate stimuli are required."

Using comments on the popular social media platform Reddit from January 2006 until September 2017, we showed how changes in the framing of same-sex marriage in public discourse relate to changes in public opinion. We used a topic model to show that the contributions of certain protected-values-based topics to the debate (religious arguments and freedom of opinion) increased prior to the emergence of a public consensus in support of same-sex marriage (Gallup, 2017), and declined afterward. In contrast, the discussion of certain consequentialist topics (the impact of politicians’ stance and same-sex marriage as a matter of policy) showed the opposite pattern. Our results reinforce the meaningfulness of protected values and consequentialism as relevant dimensions for describing public discourse and highlight the usefulness of unsupervised machine-learning methods in tackling questions about social attitude change."
Rand R. Wilcox,Behavior Research Methods,robust principal components a generalized variance perspective,2008,"This article compares several methods for performing robust principal component analysis, two of which have not been considered in previous articles. The criterion here, unlike that of extant articles aimed at comparing methods, is how well a method maximizes a robust version of the generalized variance of the projected data. This is in contrast to maximizing some measure of scatter associated with the marginal distributions of the projected scores, which does not take into account the overall structure of the projected data. Included are comparisons in which distributions are not elliptically symmetric. One of the new methods simply removes outliers using a projection-type multivariate outlier detection method that has been found to perform well relative to other outlier detection methods that have been proposed. The other new method belongs to the class of projection pursuit techniques and differs from other projection pursuit methods in terms of the function it tries to maximize. The comparisons include the method derived by Maronna (2005), the spherical method derived by Locantore et al. (1999), as well as a method proposed by Hubert, Rousseeuw, and Vanden Branden (2005). From the perspective used, the method by Hubert et al. (2005), the spherical method, and one of the new methods dominate the method derived by Maronna."

The Psychology Experiment Authoring Kit (PEAK) is a novel spreadsheet-based interface allowing students and researchers with rudimentary spreadsheet skills to create cognitive and cognitive neuroscience experiments in minutes. Students fill in a spreadsheet listing of independent variables and stimuli, insert columns that represent experimental objects such as slides (presenting text, pictures, and sounds) and feedback displays to create complete experiments, all within a single spreadsheet. The application then executes experiments with centisecond precision. Formal usability testing was done in two stages: (1) detailed coding of 10 individual subjects in one-on-one experimenter/subject videotaped sessions and (2) classroom testing of 64 undergraduates. In both individual and classroom testing, the students learned to effectively use PEAK within 2 h, and were able to create a lexical decision experiment in under 10 min. Findings from the individual testing in Stage 1 resulted in significant changes to documentation and training materials and identification of bugs to be corrected. Stage 2 testing identified additional bugs to be corrected and new features to be considered to facilitate student understanding of the experiment model. Such testing will improve the approach with each semester. The students were typically able to create their own projects in 2 h."

Since the test is nonverbal, it can be applied to many different populations and has been used all over the world (Court & Raven, 1995). However, relatively few matrices are in the sets developed by Raven, which limits their use in experiments requiring large numbers of stimuli. For the present study, we analyzed the types of relations that appear in Raven’s original Standard Progressive Matrices (SPMs) and created a software tool that can combine the same types of relations according to parameters chosen by the experimenter, to produce very large numbers of matrix problems with specific properties. We then conducted a norming study in which the matrices we generated were compared with the actual SPMs. This study showed that the generated matrices both covered and expanded on the range of problem difficulties provided by the SPMs."

Several strategies have been proposed to choose the appropriate dimensionality. In the present paper, the traditional dimensionality choice criteria were evaluated and compared to a method based on the prediction of an external criterion. Two studies were conducted in which typicality of an exemplar within a semantic concept was predicted from its distance to the concept centroid. In contrast to the low-dimensional solutions selected by the traditional methods, predictions of an external criterion improved with additional dimensions up till dimensionalities that were much higher than what is common in the literature. This suggests that traditional methods underestimate the richness of semantic concepts as revealed in spatial representations derived from similarity measures."

It is unclear, however, how to statistically quantify the amount of signal present in CIs, which limits the interpretability of these images. In this article, we propose a novel metric, infoVal, which assesses informational value relative to a resampled random distribution and can be interpreted like a z score. In the first part, we define the infoVal metric and show, through simulations, that it adheres to typical Type I error rates under various task conditions (internal validity). In the second part, we show that the metric correlates with markers of data quality in empirical reverse-correlation data, such as the subjective recognizability, objective discriminability, and test–retest reliability of the CIs (convergent validity). In the final part, we demonstrate how the infoVal metric can be used to compare the informational value of reverse-correlation datasets, by comparing data acquired online with data acquired in a controlled lab environment. We recommend a new standard of good practice in which researchers assess the infoVal scores of reverse-correlation data in order to ensure that they do not read signal in CIs where no signal is present. The infoVal metric is implemented in the open-source rcicr R package, to facilitate its adoption."

The TIS was created to provide a measure of change for important life transitions, including an index of their transitional properties and magnitude. Pilot work prior to Study 1 led to the creation of a 95-item version (TIS-95). A principal components analysis of TIS-95 (n = 215) resulted in two dimensions that we rotated to a Varimax criterion and interpreted as (1) material change (e.g., “This event changed where I live”) and (2) psychological change (e.g., “This event changed the way I think about things”). TIS-95 was reduced to 25 items. In Study 2, the structure of TIS-25 was replicated (n = 531) using the same method. The best 12 items were retained. TIS-12 was evaluated in two random split-half samples (n = 557 and n = 553). These samples produced essentially identical results, as assessed through factor comparison. The cumulative scales formed from items constituting each factor demonstrated good internal consistency (Cronbach’s alpha ranged from .79 to .86)."
Stefan ScherbaumPascal J.

As is common for a novel method, the exact methodological procedures employed in an individual study are still relatively idiosyncratic and the effects of different methodological setups on mouse-tracking measures have not been explored so far. Here, we study the impact of one commonly occurring methodological variation, namely whether participants have to initiate their mouse movements to trigger stimulus presentation (dynamic starting condition) or whether the stimulus is presented automatically after a fixed delay and participants can freely decide when to initiate their movements (static starting condition). We compared data from a previous study in which participants performed a mouse-tracking version of a Simon task with a dynamic starting condition to data from a new study that employed a static starting condition in an otherwise identical setup. Results showed reliable Simon effects and Congruency Sequence effects on response time (RT) and discrete trial-level mouse-tracking measures (i.e., average deviation) in both starting conditions. In contrast, within-trial continuous measures (i.e., extracted temporal segments) were weaker and occurred in a more temporally compressed way in the static compared to the dynamic starting condition. This was in line with generally less consistent movements within and across participants in the static compared to the dynamic condition. Our results suggest that studies that use within-trial continuous measures to assess dynamic aspects of mouse movements should apply dynamic starting procedures to enhance the leakage of cognitive processing into the mouse movements."

The theory predicts that reliance on gist mental representations (as opposed to verbatim) is more effective in reducing health risks and improving decision making. Technical information was translated into decision-relevant gist representations and gist principles (i.e., healthy values). The SKO was hypothesized to facilitate extracting these gist representations and principles by engaging women in dialogue, “understanding” their responses, and replying appropriately to prompt additional engagement. Participants were randomly assigned to either the obesity prevention tutorial (GistFit) or a control tutorial containing different content using the same technology. Participants were administered assessments of knowledge about nutrition and exercise, gist comprehension, gist principles, behavioral intentions and self-reported behavior. An analysis of engagement in tutorial dialogues and responses to multiple-choice questions to check understanding throughout the tutorial revealed significant correlations between these conversations and scores on subsequent knowledge tests and gist comprehension. Knowledge and comprehension measures correlated with healthier behavior and greater intentions to perform healthy behavior. Differences between GistFit and control tutorials were greater for participants who engaged more fully. Thus, results are consistent with the hypothesis that active engagement with a new gist-based ITS, rather than a passive memorization of verbatim details, was associated with an array of known psychosocial mediators of preventive health decisions, such as knowledge acquisition, and gist comprehension."
John AllbuttJonathan LingMartin RowleyMohammed Shafiullah,Behavior Research Methods,vividness of visual imagery and social desirable responding correlations of the vividness of visual imagery questionnaire with the balanced inventory of desirable responding and the marlowecrowne scale,2011,"Correlational research investigating the relationship between scores on self-report imagery questionnaires and measures of social desirable responding has shown only a weak association. However, researchers have argued that this research may have underestimated the size of the relationship because it relied primarily on the Marlowe–Crowne scale (MC; Crowne & Marlowe, Journal of Consulting Psychology, 24, 349–354, 1960), which loads primarily on the least relevant form of social desirable responding for this particular context, the moralistic bias. Here we report the analysis of data correlating the Vividness of Visual Imagery Questionnaire (VVIQ; Marks, Journal of Mental Imagery, 19, 153–166, 1973) with the Balanced Inventory of Desirable Responding (BIDR; Paulhus, 2002) and the MC scale under anonymous testing conditions. The VVIQ correlated significantly with the Self-Deceptive Enhancement (SDE) and Agency Management (AM) BIDR subscales and with the MC. The largest correlation was with SDE. The ability of SDE to predict VVIQ scores was not significantly enhanced by adding either AM or MC. Correlations between the VVIQ and BIDR egoistic scales were larger when the BIDR was continuously rather than dichotomously scored. This analysis indicates that the relationship between self-reported imagery and social desirable responding is likely to be stronger than previously thought."
Darko OdicHee Yeon ImRobert EisingerRyan LyJustin Halberda,Behavior Research Methods,psimle a maximum likelihood estimation approach to estimating psychophysical scaling and variability more reliably efficiently and flexibly,2016,"A simple and popular psychophysical model—usually described as overlapping Gaussian tuning curves arranged along an ordered internal scale—is capable of accurately describing both human and nonhuman behavioral performance and neural coding in magnitude estimation, production, and reproduction tasks for most psychological dimensions (e.g., time, space, number, or brightness). This model traditionally includes two parameters that determine how a physical stimulus is transformed into a psychological magnitude: (1) an exponent that describes the compression or expansion of the physical signal into the relevant psychological scale (β), and (2) an estimate of the amount of inherent variability (often called internal noise) in the Gaussian activations along the psychological scale (σ). To date, linear slopes on log–log plots have traditionally been used to estimate β, and a completely separate method of averaging coefficients of variance has been used to estimate σ. We provide a respectful, yet critical, review of these traditional methods, and offer a tutorial on a maximum-likelihood estimation (MLE) and a Bayesian estimation method for estimating both β and σ [PsiMLE(β,σ)], coupled with free software that researchers can use to implement it without a background in MLE or Bayesian statistics (R-PsiMLE). We demonstrate the validity, reliability, efficiency, and flexibility of this method through a series of simulations and behavioral experiments, and find the new method to be superior to the traditional methods in all respects."

The use of such a standardized measure ensures that the individuals tested will conform to a specific neuropsychological profile, allowing for comparisons across studies and research groups. Recently, a number of researchers have published credible critiques of the usefulness of the MBEA as a diagnostic tool for amusia. Here we argue that the MBEA and its online counterpart, the AMUSIA tests (Peretz et al.

The goal of this article is to present, in detailed and easily replicable format, the full protocol through which congenital amusics should be identified. In providing information that has often gone unreported in published articles, we aim to clarify the strengths and limitations of the MBEA and to make recommendations for its continued use by the research community as part of the Montreal Protocol for Identification of Amusia."

Subjective differences and ambiguity of transparency make judgments difficult, and a computational alternative based on a general model might be a way to average across subjective differences. In the present study, we propose two approaches based on latent semantic analysis (Landauer & Dumais in Psychological Review 104:211–240, 1997): Model 1 compares the semantic similarity between a compound word and each of its constituents, and Model 2 derives the dominant meaning of a constituent from a clustering analysis of morphological family members (e.g., “butterfingers” or “buttermilk” for “butter”). The proposed models successfully predicted participants’ transparency ratings, and we recommend that experimenters use Model 1 for English compounds and Model 2 for Chinese compounds, on the basis of differences in raters’ morphological processing in the different writing systems. The dominance of lexical meaning, semantic transparency, and the average similarity between all pairs within a morphological family are provided, and practical applications for future studies are discussed."
Morten MoshagenJochen MuschEdgar Erdfelder,Behavior Research Methods,a stochastic lie detector,2012,"Surveys on sensitive issues provide distorted prevalence estimates when participants fail to respond truthfully. The randomized-response technique (RRT) encourages more honest responding by adding random noise to responses, thereby removing any direct link between a participant’s response and his or her true status with regard to a sensitive attribute. However, in spite of the increased confidentiality, some respondents still refuse to disclose sensitive attitudes or behaviors. To remedy this problem, we propose an extension of Mangat’s (Journal of the Royal Statistical Society: Series B, 56, 93–95, 1994) variant of the RRT that allows for determining whether participants respond truthfully. This method offers the genuine advantage of providing undistorted prevalence estimates for sensitive attributes even if respondents fail to respond truthfully. We show how to implement the method using both closed-form equations and easily accessible free software for multinomial processing tree models. Moreover, we report the results of two survey experiments that provide evidence for the validity of our extension of Mangat’s RRT approach."

The results showed that the data obtained via the two online recruitment platforms, the Amazon Mechanical Turk crowdsourcing site and the virtual environment of Second Life, were statistically equivalent to the data obtained from the college sample, on the basis of means of standardized measures of psychological stress and sleep quality. Additionally, correlations between the sleep and stress measures were not statistically different between the groups. These results, along with practical considerations for the use of these recruitment platforms, are discussed, and recommendations for other researchers who may be considering the use of these platforms are provided."
C. ImbaultD. ShoreV. Kuperman,Behavior Research Methods,reliability of the sliding scale for collecting affective responses to words,2018,"Warriner, Shore, Schmidt, Imbault, and Kuperman, Canadian Journal of Experimental Psychology, 71; 71–88 (2017) have recently proposed a slider task in which participants move a manikin on a computer screen toward or further away from a word, and the distance (in pixels) is a measure of the word’s valence. Warriner, Shore, Schmidt, Imbault, and Kuperman, Canadian Journal of Experimental Psychology, 71; 71–88 (2017) showed this task to be more valid than the widely used rating task, but they did not examine the reliability of the new methodology. In this study we investigated multiple aspects of this task’s reliability. In Experiment 1 (Exps. 1.1–1.6), we showed that the sliding scale has high split-half reliability (r = .868 to .931). In Experiment 2, we also showed that the slider task elicits consistent repeated responses both within a single session (Exp. 2: r = .804) and across two sessions separated by one week (Exp. 3: r = .754). Overall, the slider task, in addition to having high validity, is highly reliable."
Carmen BrankaerPol GhesquièreBert De Smedt,Behavior Research Methods,symbolic magnitude processing in elementary school children a group administered paper and pencil measure symp test,2017,"The ability to compare symbolic numerical magnitudes correlates with children’s concurrent and future mathematics achievement. We developed and evaluated a quick timed paper-and-pencil measure that can easily be used, for example in large-scale research, in which children have to cross out the numerically larger of two Arabic one- and two-digit numbers (SYMP Test). We investigated performance on this test in 1,588 primary school children (Grades 1–6) and examined in each grade its associations with mathematics achievement. The SYMP Test had satisfactory test-retest reliability. The SYMP Test showed significant and stable correlations with mathematics achievement for both one-digit and two-digit comparison, across all grades. This replicates the previously observed association between symbolic numerical magnitude processing and mathematics achievement, but extends it by showing that the association is observed in all grades in primary education and occurs for single- as well as multi-digit processing. Children with mathematical learning difficulties performed significantly lower on one-digit comparison and two-digit comparison in all grades. This all suggests satisfactory construct and criterion-related validity of the SYMP Test, which can be used in research, when performing large-scale (intervention) studies, and by practitioners, as screening measure to identify children at risk for mathematical difficulties or dyscalculia."
Adrian HoffmannJochen Musch,Behavior Research Methods,assessing the validity of two indirect questioning techniques a stochastic lie detector versus the crosswise model,2016,"Estimates of the prevalence of sensitive attributes obtained through direct questions are prone to being distorted by untruthful responding. Indirect questioning procedures such as the Randomized Response Technique (RRT) aim to control for the influence of social desirability bias. However, even on RRT surveys, some participants may disobey the instructions in an attempt to conceal their true status. In the present study, we experimentally compared the validity of two competing indirect questioning techniques that presumably offer a solution to the problem of nonadherent respondents: the Stochastic Lie Detector and the Crosswise Model. For two sensitive attributes, both techniques met the “more is better” criterion. Their application resulted in higher, and thus presumably more valid, prevalence estimates than a direct question. Only the Crosswise Model, however, adequately estimated the known prevalence of a nonsensitive control attribute."
Birk DiedenhofenJochen Musch,Behavior Research Methods,pagefocus using paradata to detect and prevent cheating on online achievement tests,2017,"Cheating threatens the validity of unproctored online achievement tests. To address this problem, we developed PageFocus, a JavaScript that detects when participants abandon test pages by switching to another window or browser tab. In a first study, we aimed at testing whether PageFocus could detect and prevent cheating. We asked 115 lab and 186 online participants to complete a knowledge test comprising items that were difficult to answer but easy to look up on the Internet. Half of the participants were invited to look up the solutions, which significantly increased their test scores. The PageFocus script detected test takers who abandoned the test page with very high sensitivity and specificity, and successfully reduced cheating by generating a popup message that asked participants not to cheat. In a second study, 510 online participants completed a knowledge test comprising items that could easily be looked up and a reasoning task involving matrices that were impossible to look up. In a first group, a performance-related monetary reward was promised to the top scorers; in a second group, participants took part in a lottery that provided performance-unrelated rewards; and in a third group, no incentive was offered. PageFocus revealed that participants cheated more when performance-related incentives were offered. As expected, however, this effect was limited to items that could easily be looked up. We recommend that PageFocus be routinely employed to detect and prevent cheating on online achievement tests."

Previous research (Gregg in Applied Cognitive Psychology, 21, 621–647, 2007) showed that a computer-based TARA was about 80 % accurate when its statements conveyed demographic facts or religious views. Here, we tested the TARA’s diagnostic potential when its statements conveyed attitudes—here, toward both branded and generic consumer products—across different versions of the TARA (Exps. 1a, 1b, and 1c), as well as across consecutive administrations (Exp. 2). The results generalized well across versions, and maximal accuracy rates exceeding 80 % were obtained, although accuracy declined somewhat upon readministration. Overall, the TARA shows promise as a comparatively cheap, convenient, and diagnostic index of lying about attitudes."
Franziska GeringswaldFlorian Johannes BaumgartnerStefan Pollmann,Behavior Research Methods,a behavioral task for the validation of a gaze contingent simulated scotoma,2013,"Gaze-contingent displays provide a valuable method in visual research for controlling visual input and investigating its visual and cognitive processing. Although the body of research using gaze-contingent retinal stabilization techniques has grown considerably during the last decade, only few studies have been concerned with the reliability of the specific real-time simulations applied. Using a Landolt ring discrimination task, we present a behavioral validation of gaze-contingent central scotoma simulation in healthy observers. Importantly, behavioral testing is necessary to show whether the simulation impairs foveal processing of visual information. This test becomes even more crucial when researchers are faced with null results in a task performed with the scotoma, as compared with a control condition. It must be ruled out that the lack of behavioral effects results from a type II error caused by improper implementation before conclusions about foveal contributions to the given task may be drawn. In our experiment, the scotoma effectively prevented foveal processing of the visual stimuli, leading to significantly reduced response accuracies, as compared with unimpaired vision. Moreover, the final fixation at the time of the participants’ responses was placed close to the target position in the unimpaired condition, whereas the distance to the target was enhanced with the scotoma, indicating that the observers were not able to discriminate visual target stimuli from distractors, due to the scotoma. The present work presents a validated behavioral testing method for the efficiency of gaze-contingent scotoma simulations, including code for implementation. In addition, solutions for common methodological problems are discussed."
Daniel W. HeckAdrian HoffmannMorten Moshagen,Behavior Research Methods,detecting nonadherence without loss in efficiency a simple extension of the crosswise model,2018,"In surveys concerning sensitive behavior or attitudes, respondents often do not answer truthfully, because of social desirability bias. To elicit more honest responding, the randomized-response (RR) technique aims at increasing perceived and actual anonymity by prompting respondents to answer with a randomly modified and thus uninformative response. In the crosswise model, as a particularly promising variant of the RR, this is achieved by adding a second, nonsensitive question and by prompting respondents to answer both questions jointly. Despite increased privacy protection and empirically higher prevalence estimates of socially undesirable behaviors, evidence also suggests that some respondents might still not adhere to the instructions, in turn leading to questionable results. Herein we propose an extension of the crosswise model (ECWM) that makes it possible to detect several types of response biases with adequate power in realistic sample sizes. Importantly, the ECWM allows for testing the validity of the model’s assumptions without any loss in statistical efficiency. Finally, we provide an empirical example supporting the usefulness of the ECWM."

Liversedge,Behavior Research Methods,investigating eye movement acquisition and analysis technologies as a causal factor in differential prevalence of crossed and uncrossed fixation disparity during reading and dot scanning,2013,"Previous studies examining binocular coordination during reading have reported conflicting results in terms of the nature of disparity (e.g. Kliegl, Nuthmann, & Engbert (Journal of Experimental Psychology General 135:12-35, 2006); Liversedge, White, Findlay, & Rayner (Vision Research 46:2363-2374, 2006). One potential cause of this inconsistency is differences in acquisition devices and associated analysis technologies. We tested this by directly comparing binocular eye movement recordings made using SR Research EyeLink 1000 and the Fourward Technologies Inc. DPI binocular eye-tracking systems. Participants read sentences or scanned horizontal rows of dot strings; for each participant, half the data were recorded with the EyeLink, and the other half with the DPIs. The viewing conditions in both testing laboratories were set to be very similar. Monocular calibrations were used. The majority of fixations recorded using either system were aligned, although data from the EyeLink system showed greater disparity magnitudes. Critically, for unaligned fixations, the data from both systems showed a majority of uncrossed fixations. These results suggest that variability in previous reports of binocular fixation alignment is attributable to the specific viewing conditions associated with a particular experiment (variables such as luminance and viewing distance), rather than acquisition and analysis software and hardware."

BRCA Gist is an ITS developed using AutoTutor Lite, a Web-based version of AutoTutor. Fuzzy-trace theory theoretically motivated the development of BRCA Gist, which engages people in tutorial dialogues to teach them about genetic breast cancer risk. We describe an empirical method to create tutorial dialogues and fine-tune the calibration of BRCA Gist’s semantic processing engine without a team of computer scientists. We created five interactive dialogues centered on pedagogic questions such as “What should someone do if she receives a positive result for genetic risk of breast cancer?” This method involved an iterative refinement process of repeated testing with different texts and successively making adjustments to the tutor’s expectations and settings in order to improve performance. The goal of this method was to enable BRCA Gist to interpret and respond to answers in a manner that best facilitated learning. We developed a method to analyze the efficacy of the tutor’s dialogues. We found that BRCA Gist’s assessment of participants’ answers was highly correlated with the quality of the answers found by trained human judges using a reliable rubric. The dialogue quality between users and BRCA Gist predicted performance on a breast cancer risk knowledge test completed after exposure to the tutor. The appropriateness of BRCA Gist’s feedback also predicted the quality of answers and breast cancer risk knowledge test scores."
Holly P. O’RourkeDavid P. MacKinnon,Behavior Research Methods,when the test of mediation is more powerful than the test of the total effect,2015,"Although previous research has studied power in mediation models, the extent to which the inclusion of a mediator will increase power has not been investigated. To address this deficit, in a first study we compared the analytical power values of the mediated effect and the total effect in a single-mediator model, to identify the situations in which the inclusion of one mediator increased statistical power. The results from this first study indicated that including a mediator increased statistical power in small samples with large coefficients and in large samples with small coefficients, and when coefficients were nonzero and equal across models. Next, we identified conditions under which power was greater for the test of the total mediated effect than for the test of the total effect in the parallel two-mediator model. These results indicated that including two mediators increased power in small samples with large coefficients and in large samples with small coefficients, the same pattern of results that had been found in the first study. Finally, we assessed the analytical power for a sequential (three-path) two-mediator model and compared the power to detect the three-path mediated effect to the power to detect both the test of the total effect and the test of the mediated effect for the single-mediator model. The results indicated that the three-path mediated effect had more power than the mediated effect from the single-mediator model and the test of the total effect. Practical implications of these results for researchers are then discussed."
Susannah B. F. PaletzChristian D. Schunn,Behavior Research Methods,assessing group level participation in fluid teams testing a new metric,2011,"Participation is an important factor in team success. We propose a new metric of participation equality that provides an unbiased estimate across groups of different sizes and across those that change size over time. Using 11 h of transcribed utterances from informal, fluid, colocated workgroup meetings, we compared the associations of this metric with coded equality of participation and standard deviation. While coded participation and our metric had similar patterns of findings, standard deviation had a somewhat different pattern, suggesting that it might lead to incorrect assessments with fluid teams. Exploratory analyses suggest that, as compared with mixed-age/status groups, groups of younger faculty had more equal participation and that the presence of negative affect words was associated with more dominated participation. Future research can take advantage of this new metric to further theory on team processes in both face-to-face and distributed settings."
Johannes TitzAgnes ScholzPeter Sedlmeier,Behavior Research Methods,comparing eye trackers by correlating their eye metric data,2018,"Up to now, the potential of eye tracking in science as well as in everyday life has not been fully realized because of the high acquisition cost of trackers. Recently, manufacturers have introduced low-cost devices, preparing the way for wider use of this underutilized technology. As soon as scientists show independently of the manufacturers that low-cost devices are accurate enough for application and research, the real advent of eye trackers will have arrived. To facilitate this development, we propose a simple approach for comparing two eye trackers by adopting a method that psychologists have been practicing in diagnostics for decades: correlating constructs to show reliability and validity. In a laboratory study, we ran the newer, low-cost EyeTribe eye tracker and an established SensoMotoric Instruments eye tracker at the same time, positioning one above the other. This design allowed us to directly correlate the eye-tracking metrics of the two devices over time. The experiment was embedded in a research project on memory where 26 participants viewed pictures or words and had to make cognitive judgments afterwards. The outputs of both trackers, that is, the pupil size and point of regard, were highly correlated, as estimated in a mixed effects model. Furthermore, calibration quality explained a substantial amount of individual differences for gaze, but not pupil size. Since data quality is not compromised, we conclude that low-cost eye trackers, in many cases, may be reliable alternatives to established devices."

The number of cancelled targets and their location can be used to diagnose the neglect syndrome after stroke. In addition, the organization of search provides a potentially useful way to measure executive control over multitarget search. Although many useful cancellation measures have been introduced, most fail to make their way into research studies and clinical practice due to the practical difficulty of acquiring such parameters from traditional pen-and-paper measures. Here we present new, open-source software that is freely available to all. It allows researchers and clinicians to flexibly administer computerized cancellation tasks using stimuli of their choice, and to directly analyze the data in a convenient manner. The automated analysis suite provides output that includes almost all of the currently existing measures, as well as several new ones introduced here. All tasks can be performed using either a computer mouse or a touchscreen as an input device, and an online version of the task runtime is available for tablet devices. A summary of the results is produced in a single A4-sized PDF document, including high quality data visualizations. For research purposes, batch analysis of large datasets is possible. In sum, CancellationTools allows users to employ a flexible, computerized cancellation task, which provides extensive benefits and ease of use."

We statistically analyzed the distribution of the number of studies of the meta-analyses, the distribution of the sample sizes in the studies of each meta-analysis, the distribution of the effect sizes in each of the meta-analyses, the distribution of the between-studies variance values, and the Pearson correlations between effect size and sample size in each meta-analysis. The results are presented as a function of the type of standardized mean difference: posttest standardized mean difference, standardized mean change from pretest to posttest, and standardized mean change difference between groups. These findings will help researchers design future Monte Carlo and theoretical studies on the performance of meta-analytic procedures, based on the manipulation of realistic model assumptions and parameters of the meta-analyses. Furthermore, the analysis of the distribution of the mean effect sizes through the meta-analyses provides a specific guide for the interpretation of the clinical significance of the different types of standardized mean differences within the field of the evaluation of clinical psychological interventions."
Donghoh KimSe-Kang Kim,Behavior Research Methods,comparing patterns of component loadings principal component analysis pca versus independent component analysis ica in analyzing multivariate non normal data,2012,"Principal component analysis identifies uncorrelated components from correlated variables, and a few of these uncorrelated components usually account for most of the information in the input variables. Researchers interpret each component as a separate entity representing a latent trait or profile in a population. However, the components are guaranteed to be independent and uncorrelated only when the multivariate normality of the variables is assumed. If the normality assumption does not hold, components are guaranteed to be uncorrelated, but not independent. If the independence assumption is violated, each component cannot be uniquely interpreted because of contamination by other components. Therefore, in the present study, we introduced independent component analysis, whose components are uncorrelated and independent even when the multivariate normality assumption is violated, and each component carries unique information."

We begin by discussing some of the advantages of doing experiments on Mechanical Turk, such as easy access to a large, stable, and diverse subject pool, the low cost of doing experiments, and faster iteration between developing theory and executing experiments. While other methods of conducting behavioral research may be comparable to or even better than Mechanical Turk on one or more of the axes outlined above, we will show that when taken as a whole Mechanical Turk can be a useful tool for many researchers. We will discuss how the behavior of workers compares with that of experts and laboratory subjects. Then we will illustrate the mechanics of putting a task on Mechanical Turk, including recruiting subjects, executing the task, and reviewing the work that was submitted. We also provide solutions to common problems that a researcher might face when executing their research on this platform, including techniques for conducting synchronous experiments, methods for ensuring high-quality work, how to keep data private, and how to maintain code security."

In the present study, we experimentally manipulated response delay in a variation of the SART and found that commission errors, which are commonly used as an index of lapses in sustained attention, were a systematic function of manipulated differences in response delay. Delaying responses to roughly 800 ms after stimulus onset reduced commission errors substantially. We suggest the possibility that any technique that affects response speed will indirectly alter error rates independently of improvements in sustained attention. Investigators therefore need to carefully explore, report, and correct for changes in response speed that accompany improvements in performance or, alternatively, to employ tasks that control for response speed."

RMediation produces CIs using methods based on the distribution of product, Monte Carlo simulations, and an asymptotic normal distribution. Furthermore, RMediation generates percentiles, quantiles, and the plot of the distribution and CI for the mediated effect.

A photodiode detected a change in the screen’s luminosity and triggered a solenoid that pressed a key on the keyboard. The RTs collected in this way were reliable, but could be as much as 100 ms too long. The standard deviation of the measured RTs varied between 2.5 and 10 ms, and the distributions approximated a normal distribution. Surprisingly, two recent Apple-branded USB keyboards differed in their accuracy by as much as 20 ms. The most accurate RTs were collected when an external CRT was used to display the stimuli and Psychtoolbox was able to synchronize presentation with the screen refresh. We conclude that RTs collected on stock iMacs can detect a difference as small as 5–10 ms under realistic conditions, and this dictates which types of research should or should not use these systems."

A full information approach ensures unbiased estimates for data missing at random. Exceeding the capability of prior methods, up to 13 ordinal variables can be included before integration time increases beyond 1 s per row. The method relies on the axiom of conditional probability to split apart the distribution of continuous and ordinal variables. Due to the symmetry of the axiom, two similar methods are available.

The test consists of two parts (A and B) and requires drawing a trail between elements. Many patients are assessed with their non-dominant hand because of motor dysfunction that prevents them from using their dominant hand. Since drawing with the non-dominant hand is not an automatic task for many people, we explored the effect of hand use on TMT performance. The TMT was administered digitally in order to analyze new outcome measures in addition to total completion time. In a sample of 82 healthy participants, we found that non-dominant hand use increased completion times on the TMT B but not on the TMT A. The average completion time increased by almost 5 seconds, which may be clinically relevant. A substantial number of participants who performed the TMT with their non-dominant hand had a B/A ratio score of 2.5 or higher. In clinical practice, an abnormally high B/A ratio score may be falsely attributed to cognitive dysfunction. With our digitized pen data, we further explored the causes of the reduced TMT B performance by using new outcome measures, including individual element completion times and interelement variability. These measures indicated selective interference between non-dominant hand use and executive functions. Both non-dominant hand use and performance of the TMT B seem to draw on the same, limited higher-order cognitive resources."

Approximately 2 % of the population suffers from a socially debilitating deficit in face recognition. More recently the existence of a similar deficit in voice perception has emerged (phonagnosia). Face perception tests have been readily available for years, advancing our understanding of underlying mechanisms in face perception. In contrast, voice perception has received less attention, and the construction of standardized voice perception tests has been neglected. Here we report the construction of the first standardized test for voice perception ability. Participants make a same/different identity decision after hearing two voice samples. Item Response Theory guided item selection to ensure the test discriminates between a range of abilities. The test provides a starting point for the systematic exploration of the cognitive and neural mechanisms underlying voice perception. With a high test-retest reliability (r=.86) and short assessment duration (~10 min) this test examines individual abilities reliably and quickly and therefore also has potential for use in developmental and neuropsychological populations."
Jules L. Ellis,Behavior Research Methods,a standard for test reliability in group research,2013,"Many authors adhere to the rule that test reliabilities should be at least .70 or .80 in group research. This article introduces a new standard according to which reliabilities can be evaluated. This standard is based on the costs or time of the experiment and of administering the test. For example, if test administration costs are 7 % of the total experimental costs, the efficient value of the reliability is .93. If the actual reliability of a test is equal to this efficient reliability, the test size maximizes the statistical power of the experiment, given the costs. As a standard in experimental research, it is proposed that the reliability of the dependent variable be close to the efficient reliability. Adhering to this standard will enhance the statistical power and reduce the costs of experiments."

Camparo,Behavior Research Methods,being of two minds assessing vacillating and simultaneous ambivalence with the density matrix,2018,"Ambivalence is a common experience that permeates a broad range of research. Unfortunately, quantifying ambivalence has proven a daunting task, with researchers limited to studying vacillating ambivalence, VA (i.e., temporal oscillations between favor/disfavor evaluations of an attitude object). Here, we demonstrate the use of the density matrix to measure both VA and what we term “simultaneous ambivalence” (SA): ambivalence that manifests itself as “in the moment” concurrent favor/disfavor evaluations. In a methodological study we gave participants the option of either single-responding or double-responding to questionnaire items regarding a controversial topic (i.e., affirmative action). Since standard statistical procedures provide no means for analyzing double responses, such data are routinely treated as “bad.” As demonstrated here, the density matrix provides an unambiguous and relatively easy means of accounting for double responses, which is our indicator of SA. Our data are well explained by a mixture model, with participants divided into two nearly equal groups of SA and non-SA participants, and provide evidence that the general phenomenon of SA transcends differences of gender and ethnicity. Further, the density matrix data are consistent with viewing SA and VA as distinct ambivalence constructs."

McIntosh,Behavior Research Methods,the prediction of intelligence in preschool children using alternative models to regression,2011,"Statistical prediction of an outcome variable using multiple independent variables is a common practice in the social and behavioral sciences. For example, neuropsychologists are sometimes called upon to provide predictions of preinjury cognitive functioning for individuals who have suffered a traumatic brain injury. Typically, these predictions are made using standard multiple linear regression models with several demographic variables (e.g., gender, ethnicity, education level) as predictors. Prior research has shown conflicting evidence regarding the ability of such models to provide accurate predictions of outcome variables such as full-scale intelligence (FSIQ) test scores. The present study had two goals: (1) to demonstrate the utility of a set of alternative prediction methods that have been applied extensively in the natural sciences and business but have not been frequently explored in the social sciences and (2) to develop models that can be used to predict premorbid cognitive functioning in preschool children. Predictions of Stanford–Binet 5 FSIQ scores for preschool-aged children is used to compare the performance of a multiple regression model with several of these alternative methods. Results demonstrate that classification and regression treesprovided more accurate predictions of FSIQ scores than does the more traditional regression approach. Implications of these results are discussed."
T. F. WilderjansE. CeulemansP. Kuppens,Behavior Research Methods,clusterwise hiclas a generic modeling strategy to trace similarities and differences in multiblock binary data,2012,"In many areas of the behavioral sciences, different groups of objects are measured on the same set of binary variables, resulting in coupled binary object × variable data blocks. Take, as an example, success/failure scores for different samples of testees, with each sample belonging to a different country, regarding a set of test items. When dealing with such data, a key challenge consists of uncovering the differences and similarities between the structural mechanisms that underlie the different blocks. To tackle this challenge for the case of a single data block, one may rely on HICLAS, in which the variables are reduced to a limited set of binary bundles that represent the underlying structural mechanisms, and the objects are given scores for these bundles. In the case of multiple binary data blocks, one may perform HICLAS on each data block separately. However, such an analysis strategy obscures the similarities and, in the case of many data blocks, also the differences between the blocks. To resolve this problem, we proposed the new Clusterwise HICLAS generic modeling strategy. In this strategy, the different data blocks are assumed to form a set of mutually exclusive clusters. For each cluster, different bundles are derived. As such, blocks belonging to the same cluster have the same bundles, whereas blocks of different clusters are modeled with different bundles. Furthermore, we evaluated the performance of Clusterwise HICLAS by means of an extensive simulation study and by applying the strategy to coupled binary data regarding emotion differentiation and regulation."

Atesh KoulCristina BecchioAndrea Cavallo,Behavior Research Methods,predpsych a toolbox for predictive machine learning based approach in experimental psychology research,2018,"Recent years have seen an increased interest in machine learning-based predictive methods for analyzing quantitative behavioral data in experimental psychology. While these methods can achieve relatively greater sensitivity compared to conventional univariate techniques, they still lack an established and accessible implementation. The aim of current work was to build an open-source R toolbox – “PredPsych” – that could make these methods readily available to all psychologists. PredPsych is a user-friendly, R toolbox based on machine-learning predictive algorithms. In this paper, we present the framework of PredPsych via the analysis of a recently published multiple-subject motion capture dataset. In addition, we discuss examples of possible research questions that can be addressed with the machine-learning algorithms implemented in PredPsych and cannot be easily addressed with univariate statistical analysis. We anticipate that PredPsych will be of use to researchers with limited programming experience not only in the field of psychology, but also in that of clinical neuroscience, enabling computational assessment of putative bio-behavioral markers for both prognosis and diagnosis."

This paper introduces a multidimensional design characterized by categorical questions that each measure a different aspect of the same sensitive attribute. The benefits of the multidimensional design are (i) a substantial gain in power and efficiency, and the potential to (i i) evaluate the goodness-of-fit of the model, and (i i i) test hypotheses about evasive response biases in case of a misfit.

Emmanuelle KristensenAnne Guerin-DuguéBertrand Rivet,Behavior Research Methods,regularization and a general linear model for event related potential estimation,2017,"The usual event-related potential (ERP) estimation is the average across epochs time-locked on stimuli of interest. These stimuli are repeated several times to improve the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and only one evoked potential is estimated inside the temporal window of interest. Consequently, the average estimation does not take into account other neural responses within the same epoch that are due to short inter stimuli intervals. These adjacent neural responses may overlap and distort the evoked potential of interest. This overlapping process is a significant issue for the eye fixation-related potential (EFRP) technique in which the epochs are time-locked on the ocular fixations. The inter fixation intervals are not experimentally controlled and can be shorter than the neural response’s latency. To begin, the Tikhonov regularization, applied to the classical average estimation, was introduced to improve the SNR for a given number of trials. The generalized cross validation was chosen to obtain the optimal value of the ridge parameter. Then, to deal with the issue of overlapping, the general linear model (GLM), was used to extract all neural responses inside an epoch. Finally, the regularization was also applied to it. The models (the classical average and the GLM with and without regularization) were compared on both simulated data and real datasets from a visual scene exploration in co-registration with an eye-tracker, and from a P300 Speller experiment. The regularization was found to improve the estimation by average for a given number of trials. The GLM was more robust and efficient, its efficiency actually reinforced by the regularization."

The neural mechanisms of prism adaptation have come under scrutiny since the observations that the technique can alleviate hemispatial neglect following stroke, and can alter spatial cognition in healthy controls. Relative to non-imaging behavioral studies, fMRI investigations of prism adaptation face several challenges arising from the confined physical environment of the scanner and the supine position of the participants. Any researcher who wishes to administer prism adaptation in an fMRI environment must adjust their procedures enough to enable the experiment to be performed, but not so much that the behavioral task departs too much from true prism adaptation. Furthermore, the specific temporal dynamics of behavioral components of prism adaptation present additional challenges for measuring their neural correlates. We developed a system for measuring the key features of prism adaptation behavior within an fMRI environment. To validate our configuration, we present behavioral (pointing) and head movement data from 11 right-hemisphere lesioned patients and 17 older controls who underwent sham and real prism adaptation in an MRI scanner. Most participants could adapt to prismatic displacement with minimal head movements, and the procedure was well tolerated. We propose recommendations for fMRI studies of prism adaptation based on the design-specific constraints and our results."
Paul H. ThibodeauLes SikosFrank H. Durgin,Behavior Research Methods,are subjective ratings of metaphors a red herring the big two dimensions of metaphoric sentences,2018,"What makes some metaphors easier to understand than others? Several psycholinguistic dimensions have been identified as candidate answers to this question, including appeals to familiarity and aptness. One way to operationalize these dimensions is to collect ratings of them from naive participants. In this article, we question the construct validity of this approach. Do ratings of aptness actually reflect the aptness of the metaphors? Are ratings of aptness measuring something different from ratings of familiarity? With two experiments and an analysis of existing datasets, we argue that ratings of metaphoric sentences are confounded by how easily people are able to understand the sentences (processing fluency). In the experiments, a context manipulation was designed to affect how fluently people would process the metaphors. Experiment 1 confirmed that the manipulation affected how quickly people understood the sentences in a response time task. Experiment 2 revealed that the same manipulation influenced ratings of such dimensions as familiarity and aptness. Finally, factor analyses—on the ratings data from Experiment 2 and from several existing datasets—revealed two underlying sources of variance in sentence-level ratings of metaphors (the “big two” dimensions of metaphoric sentences): processing fluency and figurativeness. We discuss the implications of these findings for theories of figurative-language processing by emphasizing more careful treatment of subjective ratings of metaphoric sentences, and by suggesting the use of alternative methods to manipulate and measure such dimensions as familiarity and aptness."
Richard AnderssonLinnea LarssonKenneth HolmqvistMartin StridhMarcus Nyström,Behavior Research Methods,one algorithm to rule them all an evaluation and discussion of ten eye movement event detection algorithms,2017,"Almost all eye-movement researchers use algorithms to parse raw data and detect distinct types of eye movement events, such as fixations, saccades, and pursuit, and then base their results on these. Surprisingly, these algorithms are rarely evaluated. We evaluated the classifications of ten eye-movement event detection algorithms, on data from an SMI HiSpeed 1250 system, and compared them to manual ratings of two human experts. The evaluation focused on fixations, saccades, and post-saccadic oscillations. The evaluation used both event duration parameters, and sample-by-sample comparisons to rank the algorithms. The resulting event durations varied substantially as a function of what algorithm was used. This evaluation differed from previous evaluations by considering a relatively large set of algorithms, multiple events, and data from both static and dynamic stimuli. The main conclusion is that current detectors of only fixations and saccades work reasonably well for static stimuli, but barely better than chance for dynamic stimuli. Differing results across evaluation methods make it difficult to select one winner for fixation detection. For saccade detection, however, the algorithm by Larsson, Nyström and Stridh (IEEE Transaction on Biomedical Engineering, 60(9):2484–2493,2013) outperforms all algorithms in data from both static and dynamic stimuli. The data also show how improperly selected algorithms applied to dynamic data misestimate fixation and saccade properties."
Jonathan B. FreemanRick Dale,Behavior Research Methods,assessing bimodality to detect the presence of a dual cognitive process,2013,"Researchers have long sought to distinguish between single-process and dual-process cognitive phenomena, using responses such as reaction times and, more recently, hand movements. Analysis of a response distribution’s modality has been crucial in detecting the presence of dual processes, because they tend to introduce bimodal features. Rarely, however, have bimodality measures been systematically evaluated. We carried out tests of readily available bimodality measures that any researcher may easily employ: the bimodality coefficient (BC), Hartigan’s dip statistic (HDS), and the difference in Akaike’s information criterion between one-component and two-component distribution models (AICdiff). We simulated distributions containing two response populations and examined the influences of (1) the distances between populations, (2) proportions of responses, (3) the amount of positive skew present, and (4) sample size. Distance always had a stronger effect than did proportion, and the effects of proportion greatly differed across the measures. Skew biased the measures by increasing bimodality detection, in some cases leading to anomalous interactive effects. BC and HDS were generally convergent, but a number of important discrepancies were found. AICdiff was extremely sensitive to bimodality and identified nearly all distributions as bimodal. However, all measures served to detect the presence of bimodality in comparison to unimodal simulations. We provide a validation with experimental data, discuss methodological and theoretical implications, and make recommendations regarding the choice of analysis."

Caitlin HilliardSusan Wagner Cook,Behavior Research Methods,a technique for continuous measurement of body movement from video,2017,"The movements that we make with our body vary continuously along multiple dimensions. However, many of the tools and techniques presently used for coding and analyzing hand gestures and other body movements yield categorical outcome variables. Focusing on categorical variables as the primary quantitative outcomes may mislead researchers or distort conclusions. Moreover, categorical systems may fail to capture the richness present in movement. Variations in body movement may be informative in multiple dimensions. For example, a single hand gesture has a unique size, height of production, trajectory, speed, and handshape. Slight variations in any of these features may alter how both the speaker and the listener are affected by gesture. In this paper, we describe a new method for measuring and visualizing the physical trajectory of movement using video. This method is generally accessible, requiring only video data and freely available computer software. This method allows researchers to examine features of hand gestures, body movement, and other motion, including size, height, curvature, and speed. We offer a detailed account of how to implement this approach, and we also offer some guidelines for situations where this approach may be fruitful in revealing how the body expresses information. Finally, we provide data from a small study on how speakers alter their hand gestures in response to different characteristics of a stimulus to demonstrate the utility of analyzing continuous dimensions of motion. By creating shared methods, we hope to facilitate communication between researchers from varying methodological traditions."

A comprehensive overview of the related literature is presented, and the problem of characterizing mouse movement acquisition is analyzed and discussed. Then, the quality of velocity signals acquired with this kind of device is measured on horizontal oscillatory movements by comparing the mouse data to the signals acquired simultaneously by a video motion tracking system and a digitizing tablet. A synthesis of the information gathered in this work indicates that the computer mouse can be used for the reliable acquisition of biosignals in the context of human movement studies, particularly for many applications dealing with the velocity of the end effector of the upper limb. This paper concludes by discussing the possibilities and limitations of such use."

This enables new types of experiments with simultaneous recordings of eye movement data from several participants, which is of interest for researchers in, e.g., social and educational psychology. The Lund University Humanities Laboratory recently acquired 25 remote eye trackers, which are connected over a local wireless network. As a first step toward running experiments with this setup, demanding situations with real time sharing of gaze data were investigated in terms of network performance as well as clock and screen synchronization. Results show that data can be shared with a sufficiently low packet loss (0.1 %) and latency (M = 3 ms, M A D = 2 ms) across 8 eye trackers at a rate of 60 Hz. For a similar performance using 24 computers, the send rate needs to be reduced to 20 Hz. To help researchers conduct similar measurements on their own multi-eye-tracker setup, open source software written in Python and PsychoPy are provided. Part of the software contains a minimal working example to help researchers kick-start experiments with two or more eye trackers."
Xiaowei ZhaoPing LiTeuvo Kohonen,Behavior Research Methods,contextual self organizing map software for constructing semantic representations,2011,"In this article, we introduce a software package that applies a corpus-based algorithm to derive semantic representations of words. The algorithm relies on analyses of contextual information extracted from a text corpus—specifically, analyses of word co-occurrences in a large-scale electronic database of text. Here, a target word is represented as the combination of the average of all words preceding the target and all words following it in a text corpus. The semantic representation of the target words can be further processed by a self-organizing map (SOM; Kohonen, Self-organizing maps, 2001), an unsupervised neural network model that provides efficient data extraction and representation. Due to its topography-preserving features, the SOM projects the statistical structure of the context onto a 2-D space, such that words with similar meanings cluster together, forming groups that correspond to lexically meaningful categories. Such a representation system has its applications in a variety of contexts, including computational modeling of language acquisition and processing. In this report, we present specific examples from two languages (English and Chinese) to demonstrate how the method is applied to extract the semantic representations of words."
Johann DelcourtNoam Y. MillerIain D. CouzinSimon Garnier,Behavior Research Methods,methods for the effective study of collective behavior in a radial arm maze,2018,"Collective behaviors are observed throughout nature, from bacterial colonies to human societies. Important theoretical breakthroughs have recently been made in understanding why animals produce group behaviors and how they coordinate their activities, build collective structures, and make decisions. However, standardized experimental methods to test these findings have been lacking. Notably, easily and unambiguously determining the membership of a group and the responses of an individual within that group is still a challenge. The radial arm maze is presented here as a new standardized method to investigate collective exploration and decision-making in animal groups. This paradigm gives individuals within animal groups the opportunity to make choices among a set of discrete alternatives, and these choices can easily be tracked over long periods of time. We demonstrate the usefulness of this paradigm by performing a set of refuge-site selection experiments with groups of fish. Using an open-source, robust custom image-processing algorithm, we automatically counted the number of animals in each arm of the maze to identify the majority choice. We also propose a new index to quantify the degree of group cohesion in this context. The radial arm maze paradigm provides an easy way to categorize and quantify the choices made by animals. It makes it possible to readily apply the traditional uses of the radial arm maze with single animals to the study of animal groups. Moreover, it opens up the possibility of studying questions specifically related to collective behaviors."

Here, the design of an automated Y-maze equipped with three infrared optocouplers per arm, and commanded by a reduced instruction set computer (RISC) microcontroller is described. The software was devised for recording only true entries and exits to the arms. Experimental settings are programmed via a keyboard with three buttons and a display. The sequence of arm entries and the time spent in each arm and the neutral zone (NZ) are saved as a text file in a non-volatile memory for later transfer to a USB flash memory. Data files are analyzed with a program developed under LabVIEW® environment, and the results are exported to an Excel® spreadsheet file. Variables measured are: latency to exit the starting arm, sequence and number of arm entries, number of alternations, alternation percentage, and cumulative times spent in each arm and NZ. The automated Y-maze accurately detected the SAB decrease produced in rats by the muscarinic antagonist trihexyphenidyl, and its reversal by caffeine, having 100 % concordance with the alternation percentages calculated by two trained observers who independently watched videos of the same experiments. Although the values of time spent in the arms and NZ measured by the automated system had small discrepancies with those calculated by the observers, Bland-Altman analysis showed 95 % concordance in three pairs of comparisons, while in one it was 90 %, indicating that this system is a reliable and inexpensive alternative for the study of continuous SAB in rodents."

Unbalanced designs due to missing data involving both a moderate and large number of repeated measurements and varying total sample sizes were investigated. The study also investigated the impact of using different estimation strategies for information criteria, the impact of different adjustments for calculating the criteria, and the impact of different distribution shapes. Overall, we found that the ability of consistent criteria in any of the their examined forms to select the correct model was superior under simple covariance patterns than under complex covariance patterns, and vice versa for the efficient criteria. The simulation studies covered in this paper also revealed that, regardless of method of estimation used, the consistent criteria based on number of subjects were more effective than the consistent criteria based on total number of observations, and vice versa for the efficient criteria. Furthermore, results indicated that, given a dataset with missing values, the efficient criteria were more affected than the consistent criteria by the lack of normality."
Thomas W.

Often keyboards are employed to collect buttonpresses, but their imprecision and variability decreases test power and increases the risk of false positives. Response boxes and data acquisition cards are precise, but expensive and inflexible, alternatives. We propose using open-source Arduino microcontroller boards as an inexpensive and flexible alternative. These boards connect to standard experimental software using a USB connection and a virtual serial port, or by emulating a keyboard. In our solution, an Arduino measures response latencies after being signaled the start of a trial, and communicates the latency and response back to the PC over a USB connection. We demonstrated the reliability, robustness, and precision of this communication in six studies. Test measures confirmed that the error added to the measurement had an SD of less than 1 ms. Alternatively, emulation of a keyboard results in similarly precise measurement. The Arduino performs as well as a serial response box, and better than a keyboard. In addition, our setup allows for the flexible integration of other sensors, and even actuators, to extend the cognitive science toolbox."

This allows for the measurement of the similarity between dictionaries and spans of text ranging from complete documents to individual words. We show how DDR enables dictionary authors to place greater emphasis on construct validity without sacrificing linguistic coverage. We further demonstrate the benefits of DDR on two real-world tasks and finally conduct an extensive study of the interaction between dictionary size and task performance. These studies allow us to examine how DDR and word count methods complement one another as tools for applying concept dictionaries and where each is best applied. Finally, we provide references to tools and resources to make this method both available and accessible to a broad psychological audience."

A total of 410 children (189 girls and 221 boys) were instructed to fill out the resulting Basic Empathy Scale in Children (BES-C). Results showed that, as in adulthood, the three-factor model of empathy (i.e., emotional contagion, cognitive empathy, and emotional disconnection) was more relevant than the one- and two-factor ones. This means that as early as 6 years of age, children’s responses should reflect the same organization of the three components of empathy as those of adults. In line with the literature, cognitive empathy increased and emotional disconnection decreased in middle childhood, while emotional contagion remained stable. Moreover, girls exhibited greater emotional contagion than boys, with the reverse pattern being observed for emotional disconnection. No sex difference was found regarding cognitive empathy."

The v measure compares the estimation accuracy of the ubiquitous ordinary least squares (OLS) estimator, which includes sample means as a special case, with a benchmark estimator that randomizes the direction of treatment effects. For sample and effect sizes common to experimental psychology, v suggests that OLS produces estimates that are insufficiently accurate for the type of hypotheses being tested. We demonstrate how v can be used to determine sample sizes to obtain minimum acceptable estimation accuracy. Software for calculating v is included as online supplemental material (R Core Team, 2012)."

In data collection for experimental research, estimating the required sample size beforehand is a fundamental question for obtaining sufficient statistical power and precision of the focused parameters. The present research extends previous research from Heo and Leon (2008) and Usami (2011b), by deriving closed-form formulas for determining the required sample size to test effects in experimental research with hierarchical data, and by focusing on both multisite-randomized trials (MRTs) and cluster-randomized trials (CRTs). These formulas consider both statistical power and the width of the confidence interval of a standardized effect size, on the basis of estimates from a random-intercept model for three-level data that considers both balanced and unbalanced designs. These formulas also address some important results, such as the lower bounds of the needed units at the highest levels."
Marc BrysbaertKevin Diependaele,Behavior Research Methods,dealing with zero word frequencies a review of the existing rules of thumb and a suggestion for an evidence based choice,2013,"In a critical review of the heuristics used to deal with zero word frequencies, we show that four are suboptimal, one is good, and one may be acceptable. The four suboptimal strategies are discarding words with zero frequencies, giving words with zero frequencies a very low frequency, adding 1 to the frequency per million, and making use of the Good–Turing algorithm. The good algorithm is the Laplace transformation, which consists of adding 1 to each frequency count and increasing the total corpus size by the number of word types observed. A strategy that may be acceptable is to guess the frequency of absent words on the basis of other corpora and then increasing the total corpus size by the estimated summed frequency of the missing words. A comparison with the lexical decision times of the English Lexicon Project and the British Lexicon Project suggests that the Laplace transformation gives the most useful estimates (in addition to being easy to calculate). Therefore, we recommend it to researchers."
Kenji SagaeBrian MacWhinneyAlon Lavie,"Behavior Research Methods, Instruments, & Computers",automatic parsing of parental verbal input,2004,"To evaluate theoretical proposals regarding the course of child language acquisition, researchers often need to rely on the processing of large numbers of syntacticallyparsed utterances, both from children and from their parents. Because it is so difficult to do this by hand, there are currently no parsed corpora of child language input data. To automate this process, we developed a system that combined the MOR tagger, a rule-based parser, and statistical disambiguation techniques. The resultant system obtained nearly 80% correct parses for the sentences spoken to children. To achieve this level, we had to construct a particular processing sequence that minimizes problems caused by the coverage/ ambiguity tradeoff in parser design. These procedures are particularly appropriate for use with the CHILDES database, an international corpus of transcripts. The data and programs are now freely available over the Internet."

We created a tool that is open source, enables reproducible results, and encourages cumulative science in this domain. WordSeg has a modular architecture: It combines a set of corpora description routines, multiple algorithms varying in complexity and cognitive assumptions (including several that were not publicly available, or insufficiently documented), and a rich evaluation package. In the paper, we illustrate the use of this package by analyzing a corpus of child-directed speech in various ways, which further allows us to make recommendations for experimental design of follow-up work. Supplementary materials allow readers to reproduce every result in this paper, and detailed online instructions further enable them to go beyond what we have done. Moreover, the system can be installed within container software that ensures a stable and reliable environment. Finally, by virtue of its modular architecture and transparency, WordSeg can work as an open-source platform, to which other researchers can add their own segmentation algorithms."
Patrick ConleyCurt Burgess,"Behavior Research Methods, Instruments, & Computers",a computational approach to modeling population differences,2000,"Four experiments were conducted to determine whether the Hyperspace Analogue to Language (HAL) model of semantic memory could differentiate between two different populations. An analysis of the differences in densities (or average distances between word neighbors in semantic space) in HAL matrices—generated from text corpora derived from younger and older adults—confirmed that HAL was able to distinguish between the two age groups. This difference was again detected when structured interview data were used to build the corpora. A third experiment, designed to test the specificity of HAL in detecting differences between groups, did not detect any difference in the densities of the memory representations when older adults generated both the test corpora. The final experiment, conducted on the language of adults with Alzheimer’s and normal adults, again demonstrated that HAL could discriminate between the two populations. These results suggest that HAL is capable of modeling, on the basis of changes in mean density, some of the differences between populations without modifying the model itself but, rather, by changing the text corpus from which the model creates its representations in semantic space."

A difficult task, which consisted of answering (French) biology multiple choice questions, was used to test the semantic properties of the truncated singular space and to study the relative influence of the main parameters. A dedicated software was designed to fine-tune the LSA semantic space for the multiple choice questions task. With optimal parameters, the performances of our simple model were quite surprisingly equal or superior to those of seventh- and eighthgrade students. This indicates that semantic spaces were quite good despite their low dimensions and the small sizes of the training data sets. In addition, we present an original entropy global weighting of the answers’ terms for each of the multiple choice questions, which was necessary to achieve the model’s success."

In the present study, we aimed to build on this work and demonstrate that there is a large and systematic bias in the use of personal names in the natural-language environment, such that male names are much more prevalent than female names. This bias holds over an analysis of billions of words of text, subcategorized into different genres within fiction novels, nonfiction books, and subtitles from television and film. Additionally, we showed that this bias holds across time, with more recent work displaying the same patterns as work published tens or hundreds of years previously. Finally, we showed that the main cause of the bias comes from male authors perpetuating the bias toward male names, with female authors showing a much smaller bias. This work demonstrates the potential of big-data analyses to shed light on large-scale trends in human behavior and to elucidate their causes."

McNamara,"Behavior Research Methods, Instruments, & Computers",computerizing reading training evaluation of a latent semantic analysis space for science text,2003,"The effectiveness of a domain-specific latent semantic analysis (LSA) in assessing reading strategies was examined. Students were given self-explanation reading training (SERT) and asked to think aloud after each sentence in a science text. Novice and expert human raters and two LSA spaces (general reading, science) rated the similarity of each think-aloud protocol to benchmarks representing three different reading strategies (minimal, local, and global). The science LSA space correlated highly with human judgments, and more highly than did the general reading space. Also, cosines from the science LSA spaces can distinguish between different levels of semantic similarity, but may have trouble in distinguishing local processing protocols. Thus, a domain-specific LSA space is advantageous regardless of the size of the space. The results are discussedin the context of applying the science LSA to a computer-based version of SERT that gives online feedback based on LSA cosines."

However, performing a qualitative analysis across a massive social media data set is cumbersome and impractical. Instead, researchers often extract a subset of content to analyze, but a framework to facilitate this process is currently lacking. We present a four-phased framework for improving this extraction process, which blends the capacities of data science techniques to compress large data sets into smaller spaces, with the capabilities of qualitative analysis to address research questions. We demonstrate this framework by investigating the topics of Australian Twitter commentary on climate change, using quantitative (non-negative matrix inter-joint factorization; topic alignment) and qualitative (thematic analysis) techniques. Our approach is useful for researchers seeking to perform qualitative analyses of social media, or researchers wanting to supplement their quantitative work with a qualitative analysis of broader social context and meaning."
Eyal Sagi,Behavior Research Methods,taming big data applying the experimental method to naturalistic data sets,2019,"Psychological researchers have traditionally focused on lab-based experiments to test their theories and hypotheses. Although the lab provides excellent facilities for controlled testing, some questions are best explored by collecting information that is difficult to obtain in the lab. The vast amounts of data now available to researchers can be a valuable resource in this respect. By incorporating this new realm of data and translating it into traditional laboratory methods, we can expand the reach of the lab into the wilderness of human society. This study demonstrates how the troves of linguistic data generated by humans can be used to test theories about cognition and representation. It also suggests how similar interpretations can be made of other research in cognition. The first case tests a long-standing prediction of Gentner’s natural partition hypothesis: that verb meaning is more subject to change due to the textual context in which it appears than is the meaning of nouns. Within a diachronic corpus, verbs and other relational words indeed showed more evidence of semantic change than did concrete nouns. In the second case, corpus statistics were employed to empirically support the existence of phonesthemes—nonmorphemic units of sound that are associated with aspects of meaning. A third study also supported this measure, by demonstrating that it corresponds with performance in a lab experiment. Neither of these questions can be adequately explored without the use of big data in the form of linguistic corpora."

McCarthyScott Jarvis,Behavior Research Methods,mtld vocd d and hd d a validation study of sophisticated approaches to lexical diversity assessment,2010,"The main purpose of this study was to examine the validity of the approach to lexical diversity assessment known as the measure of textual lexical diversity (MTLD). The index for this approach is calculated as the mean length of word strings that maintain a criterion level of lexical variation. To validate the MTLD approach, we compared it against the performances of the primary competing indices in the field, which include vocd-D, TTR, Maas, Yule’s K, and an HD-D index derived directly from the hypergeometric distribution function. The comparisons involved assessments of convergent validity, divergent validity, internal validity, and incremental validity. The results of our assessments of these indices across two separate corpora suggest three major findings. First, MTLD performs well with respect to all four types of validity and is, in fact, the only index not found to vary as a function of text length. Second, HD-D is a viable alternative to the vocd-D standard. And third, three of the indices—MTLD, vocd-D (or HD-D), and Maas—appear to capture unique lexical information. We conclude by advising researchers to consider using MTLD, vocd-D (or HD-D), and Maas in their studies, rather than any single index, noting that lexical diversity can be assessed in many ways and each approach may be informative as to the construct under investigation."

A script written in the software program Praat (Boersma & Weenink, 2007) detects syllables in running speech. Peaks in intensity (dB) that are preceded and followed by dips in intensity are considered to be potential syllable nuclei. The script subsequently discards peaks that are not voiced. Testing the resulting syllable counts of this script on two corpora of spoken Dutch, we obtained high correlations between speech rate calculated from human syllable counts and speech rate calculated from automatically determined syllable counts. We conclude that a syllable count measured in this automatic fashion suffices to reliably assess and compare speech rates between participants and tasks."

We compared the output of QUAID with ratings of language experts who evaluated a corpus of questions on the five classes of problems. The corpus consisted of 505 questions on 11 surveys developed by the U.S. Census Bureau.

Nicolas DirixMarc BrysbaertWouter Duyck,Behavior Research Methods,how well do word recognition measures correlate effects of language context and repeated presentations,2018,"In the present study we assessed the extent to which different word recognition time measures converge, using large databases of lexical decision times and eyetracking measures. We observed a low proportion of shared variance between these measures, which limits the validity of lexical decision times to real-life reading. We further investigated and compared the role of word frequency and length, two important predictors of word-processing latencies in these paradigms, and found that they influenced the measures to different extents. A second analysis of two different eyetracking corpora compared the eyetracking reading times for short paragraphs with those from reading of an entire book. Our results revealed that the correlations between eyetracking reading times of identical words in two different corpora are also low, suggesting that the higher-order language context in which words are presented plays a crucial role. Finally, our findings indicate that lexical decision times better resemble the average processing time of multiple presentations of the same word, across different language contexts."

Accordingly, psychological and psycholinguistic research has begun incorporating sophisticated representations of semantic content to better understand the connection between word choice and psychological processes. In this work we introduce ConversAtion level Syntax SImilarity Metric (CASSIM), a novel method for calculating conversation-level syntax similarity. CASSIM estimates the syntax similarity between conversations by automatically generating syntactical representations of the sentences in conversation, estimating the structural differences between them, and calculating an optimized estimate of the conversation-level syntax similarity. After introducing and explaining this method, we report results from two method validation experiments (Study 1) and conduct a series of analyses with CASSIM to investigate syntax accommodation in social media discourse (Study 2). We run the same experiments using two well-known existing syntactic metrics, LSM and Coh-Metrix, and compare their results to CASSIM. Overall, our results indicate that CASSIM is able to reliably measure syntax similarity and to provide robust evidence of syntax accommodation within social media discourse."

The program was developed because manual coding of large collections of computerized transcripts cannot possibly be completed within a reasonable time span. CHIP codes parent-child conversational data as stored in transcript files and computes a series of descriptive statistics based on these codes. Parental responses to child utterances and child responses to parent utterances are both coded. This allows for an analysis of the reciprocal relationship between parental and child language. Three longitudinal corpora from CHILDES (totaling 151,900 utterances) were coded and analyzed by CHIP. The results indicated a high degree of contingency between parental and child language for different word classes across a large span of development. Two main points are argued: (1) Automatic data coding and analysis programs are important new tools for transcript analysis, and (2) CHIP, as an example of such a tool, can provide detailed information concerning the exact nature of parent-child conversational interactions."

Haiying LiZhiqiang CaiArthur C. Graesser,Behavior Research Methods,computerized summary scoring crowdsourcing based latent semantic analysis,2018,"In this study we developed and evaluated a crowdsourcing-based latent semantic analysis (LSA) approach to computerized summary scoring (CSS). LSA is a frequently used mathematical component in CSS, where LSA similarity represents the extent to which the to-be-graded target summary is similar to a model summary or a set of exemplar summaries. Researchers have proposed different formulations of the model summary in previous studies, such as pregraded summaries, expert-generated summaries, or source texts. The former two methods, however, require substantial human time, effort, and costs in order to either grade or generate summaries. Using source texts does not require human effort, but it also does not predict human summary scores well. With human summary scores as the gold standard, in this study we evaluated the crowdsourcing LSA method by comparing it with seven other LSA methods that used sets of summaries from different sources (either experts or crowdsourced) of differing quality, along with source texts. Results showed that crowdsourcing LSA predicted human summary scores as well as expert-good and crowdsourcing-good summaries, and better than the other methods. A series of analyses with different numbers of crowdsourcing summaries demonstrated that the number (from 10 to 100) did not significantly affect performance. These findings imply that crowdsourcing LSA is a promising approach to CSS, because it saves human effort in generating the model summary while still yielding comparable performance. This approach to small-scale CSS provides a practical solution for instructors in courses, and also advances research on automated assessments in which student responses are expected to semantically converge on subject matter content."
Fritz GüntherCarolin DudschigBarbara Kaup,Behavior Research Methods,lsafun  an r package for computations based on latent semantic analysis,2015,"In this article, the R package LSAfun is presented. This package enables a variety of functions and computations based on Vector Semantic Models such as Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) Landauer, Foltz and Laham (Discourse Processes 25:259–284, 1998), which are procedures to obtain a high-dimensional vector representation for words (and documents) from a text corpus. Such representations are thought to capture the semantic meaning of a word (or document) and allow for semantic similarity comparisons between words to be calculated as the cosine of the angle between their associated vectors. LSAfun uses pre-created LSA spaces and provides functions for (a) Similarity Computations between words, word lists, and documents; (b) Neighborhood Computations, such as obtaining a word’s or document’s most similar words, (c) plotting such a neighborhood, as well as similarity structures for any word lists, in a two- or three-dimensional approximation using Multidimensional Scaling, (d) Applied Functions, such as computing the coherence of a text, answering multiple choice questions and producing generic text summaries; and (e) Composition Methods for obtaining vector representations for two-word phrases.

Michael T. TolstonMichael A. RileyVincent MancusoVictor FinomoreGregory J. Funke,Behavior Research Methods,beyond frequency counts novel conceptual recurrence analysis metrics to index semantic coordination in team communications,2019,"Semantic alignment is a key process underlying interpersonal and team communication. However, semantic similarity is difficult to quantify, and statistical approaches designed to measure it often rely on methods that make the identification of the relative importance of key words difficult. This study outlines how conceptual recurrence analysis (CRA) can address these issues and can be used to detect conceptual structure in interpersonal communication. We developed several novel CRA metrics to analyze communication data reported previously by Mancuso, Finomore, Rahill, Blair, and Funke (Proceedings of the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society Annual Meeting, 58, 405–409, 2014), gathered from teams who worked cooperatively on a logic puzzle under different cognitive biasing contexts. CRA, like other measures of semantic coordination, relies on parameters whose values affect estimates of semantic alignment. We evaluated how the dimensionality of semantic spaces affects metrics quantifying the conceptual similarity of communicative exchanges, and whether metrics calculated from top-down, a priori semantic spaces or bottom-up semantic spaces empirically derived from each data set were more sensitive to biasing context. We found that the novel CRA measures were sensitive to manipulations of cognitive bias, and that higher-dimensional, bottom-up semantic spaces generally yielded more sensitivity to the experimental manipulations, though when the communication was evaluated with respect to specific key concepts, lower-dimensional, top-down spaces performed nearly as well. We conclude that CRA is sensitive to experimental manipulations in ways consistent with prior findings and that it presents a customizable framework for testing predictions about interpersonal communication patterns and other linguistic exchanges."
Justin GartenBrendan KennedyKenji SagaeMorteza Dehghani,Behavior Research Methods,measuring the importance of context when modeling language comprehension,2019,"It is widely accepted that language requires context in order to function as communication between speakers and listeners. As listeners, we make use of background knowledge — about the speaker, about entities and concepts, about previous utterances — in order to infer the speaker’s intended meaning. But even if there is consensus that these sources of information are a necessary component of linguistic communication, it is another matter entirely to provide a thorough, quantitative accounting for context’s interaction with language. When does context matter? What kinds of context matter in which kinds of domains? The empirical investigation of these questions is inhibited by a number of factors: the challenge of quantifying language, the boundless combinations of domains and types of context to be measured, and the challenge of selecting and applying a given construct to natural language data. In response to these factors, we introduce and demonstrate a methodological framework for testing the importance of contextual information in inferring speaker intentions from text. We apply Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) networks, a standard for representing language in its natural, sequential state, and conduct a set of experiments for predicting the persuasive intentions of speakers in political debates using different combinations of text and background information about the speaker. We show, in our modeling and discussion, that the proposed framework is suitable for empirically evaluating the manner and magnitude of context’s relevance for any number of domains and constructs."

In this article, the authors propose and validate the cohesion network analysis (CNA) model, housed within the ReaderBench platform. CNA, grounded in theories of cohesion, dialogism, and polyphony, is similar to social network analysis (SNA), but it also considers text content and discourse structure and, uniquely, uses automated cohesion indices to generate the underlying discourse representation. Thus, CNA enhances the power of SNA by explicitly considering semantic cohesion while modeling interactions between participants. The primary purpose of this article is to describe CNA analysis and to provide a proof of concept, by using ten chat conversations in which multiple participants debated the advantages of CSCL technologies. Each participant’s contributions were human-scored on the basis of their relevance in terms of covering the central concepts of the conversation. SNA metrics, applied to the CNA sociogram, were then used to assess the quality of each member’s degree of participation. The results revealed that the CNA indices were strongly correlated to the human evaluations of the conversations. Furthermore, a stepwise regression analysis indicated that the CNA indices collectively predicted 54% of the variance in the human ratings of participation. The results provide promising support for the use of automated computational assessments of collaborative participation and of individuals’ degrees of active involvement in CSCL environments."

Specifically, these approaches were developed to classify whether or not important elements of the texts were present in the essays. The first was a simple pattern-matching approach called “multi-word” that allowed for flexible matching of words and phrases in the sentences. The second technique was latent semantic analysis (LSA), which was used to compare student sentences to original source sentences using its high-dimensional vector-based representation. Finally, the third was a machine-learning technique, support vector machines, which learned a classification scheme from the corpus. The results of the study suggested that the LSA-based system was superior for detecting the presence of explicit content from the texts, but the multi-word pattern-matching approach was better for detecting inferences outside or across texts. These results suggest that the best approach for analyzing essays of this nature should draw upon multiple natural language processing approaches."

The texts of Mao Zedong, Deng Xiaoping, Jiang Zemin, and Hu Jintao were analyzed using computational linguistic techniques (a Chinese formality score) to explore the persuasive linguistic features of the leaders in the contexts of power phase, the nation’s education level, power duration, and age. The study was guided by the elaboration likelihood model of persuasion, which includes a central route (represented by formal discourse) versus a peripheral route (represented by informal discourse) to persuasion. The results revealed that these leaders adopted the formal, central route more when they were in power than before they came into power. The nation’s education level was a significant factor in the leaders’ adoption of the persuasion strategy. The leaders’ formality also decreased with their increasing age and in-power times. However, the predictability of these factors for formality had subtle differences among the different types of leaders. These results enhance our understanding of the Chinese collective leadership and the role of formality in politically persuasive messages."

We demonstrate that these text data are at a scale beyond the reach of other more common, more general-purpose libraries available through CRAN. Using the cmscu library and the smoothing implementation, we find a positive relationship between review information density and reader review ratings.

Mariah MoorePeter C. Gordon,Behavior Research Methods,reading ability and print exposure item response theory analysis of the author recognition test,2015,"In the author recognition test (ART), participants are presented with a series of names and foils and are asked to indicate which ones they recognize as authors. The test is a strong predictor of reading skill, and this predictive ability is generally explained as occurring because author knowledge is likely acquired through reading or other forms of print exposure. In this large-scale study (1,012 college student participants), we used item response theory (IRT) to analyze item (author) characteristics in order to facilitate identification of the determinants of item difficulty, provide a basis for further test development, and optimize scoring of the ART. Factor analysis suggested a potential two-factor structure of the ART, differentiating between literary and popular authors. Effective and ineffective author names were identified so as to facilitate future revisions of the ART. Analyses showed that the ART is a highly significant predictor of the time spent encoding words, as measured using eyetracking during reading. The relationship between the ART and time spent reading provided a basis for implementing a higher penalty for selecting foils, rather than the standard method of ART scoring (names selected minus foils selected). The findings provide novel support for the view that the ART is a valid indicator of reading volume. Furthermore, they show that frequency data can be used to select items of appropriate difficulty, and that frequency data from corpora based on particular time periods and types of texts may allow adaptations of the test for different populations."

The advantages of this automatic real-time approach are that obtaining speech data is nonobstrusive and is free from sensor application and calibration efforts. Different types of acoustic features derived from speech, speaker, and emotion recognition were employed (frame-level-based speech features). Combing these features with high-level contour descriptors, which capture the temporal information of frame-level descriptor contours, results in 45,088 features per speech sample. In general, the measurement proceß follows the speech-adapted steps of pattern recognition: (1) recording speech, (2) preproceßing, (3) feature computation (using perceptual and signal-proceßing-related features such as, e.g., fundamental frequency, intensity, pause patterns, formants, and cepstral coefficients), (4) dimensionality reduction, (5) claßification, and (6) evaluation. After a correlation-filter-based feature subset selection employed on the feature space in order to find most relevant features, different claßification models were trained.

Gregory E. CoxGeorge KachergisGabriel RecchiaMichael N. Jones,Behavior Research Methods,toward a scalable holographic word form representation,2011,"Phenomena in a variety of verbal tasks—for example, masked priming, lexical decision, and word naming—are typically explained in terms of similarity between word-forms. Despite the apparent commonalities between these sets of phenomena, the representations and similarity measures used to account for them are not often related. To show how this gap might be bridged, we build on the work of Hannagan, Dupoux, and Christophe, Cognitive Science 35:79-118, (2011) to explore several methods of representing visual word-forms using holographic reduced representations and to evaluate them on their ability to account for a wide range of effects in masked form priming, as well as data from lexical decision and word naming. A representation that assumes that word-internal letter groups are encoded relative to word-terminal letter groups is found to predict qualitative patterns in masked priming, as well as lexical decision and naming latencies. We then show how this representation can be integrated with the BEAGLE model of lexical semantics (Jones & Mewhort, Psychological Review 114:1–37, 2007) to enable the model to encompass a wider range of verbal tasks."

With the aim of disseminating these approaches, we introduce a text-analytic technique (Contrast Analysis of Semantic Similarity, CASS, www.casstools.org), based on the BEAGLE semantic space model (Jones & Mewhort, Psychological Review, 114, 1–37, 2007) and add new features to test between-corpora differences in semantic associations (e.g., the association between democrat and good, compared to democrat and bad). By analyzing television transcripts from cable news from a 12-month period, we reveal significant differences in political bias between television channels (liberal to conservative: MSNBC, CNN, FoxNews) and find expected differences between newscasters (Colmes, Hannity). Compared to existing measures of media bias, our measure has higher reliability. CASS can be used to investigate semantic structure when exploring any topic (e.g., self-esteem or stereotyping) that affords a large text-based database."

In the present article, we describe a system that makes it possible to study visual attention in coordination with other activity during joint action. The software links two eyetracking systems in parallel and provides an on-screen task. By locating eye movements against dynamic screen regions, it permits automatic tracking of moving on-screen objects. Using existing SR technology, the system can also cross-project each participant’s eyetrack and mouse location onto the other’s on-screen work space. Keeping a complete record of eyetrack and on-screen events in the same format as subsequent human coding, the system permits the analysis of multiple modalities. The software offers new approaches to spontaneous multimodal communication: joint action and joint attention. These capacities are demonstrated using an experimental paradigm for cooperative on-screen assembly of a two-dimensional model. The software is available under an open source license."
Sarah H. SolomonJohn D. MedagliaSharon L. Thompson-Schill,Behavior Research Methods,implementing a concept network model,2019,"The same concept can mean different things or be instantiated in different forms, depending on context, suggesting a degree of flexibility within the conceptual system. We propose that a feature-based network model can be used to capture and predict this flexibility. We modeled individual concepts (e.g., banana, bottle) as graph-theoretical networks, in which properties (e.g., yellow, sweet) were represented as nodes and their associations as edges. In this framework, networks capture within-concept statistics that reflect how properties relate to one another across instances of a concept. We extracted formal measures of these networks that capture different aspects of network structure, and explored whether a concept’s network structure relates to its flexibility of use. To do so, we compared network measures to a text-based measure of semantic diversity, as well as to empirical data from a figurative-language task and an alternative-uses task. We found that network-based measures were predictive of the text-based and empirical measures of flexible concept use, highlighting the ability of this approach to formally capture relevant characteristics of conceptual structure. Conceptual flexibility is a fundamental attribute of the cognitive and semantic systems, and in this proof of concept we reveal that variations in concept representation and use can be formally understood in terms of the informational content and topology of concept networks."

Benjamin SchlossPing Li,Behavior Research Methods,disentangling narrow and coarse semantic networks in the brain the role of computational models of word meaning,2017,"There has been a recent boom in research relating semantic space computational models to fMRI data, in an effort to better understand how the brain represents semantic information. In the first study reported here, we expanded on a previous study to examine how different semantic space models and modeling parameters affect the abilities of these computational models to predict brain activation in a data-driven set of 500 selected voxels. The findings suggest that these computational models may contain distinct types of semantic information that relate to different brain areas in different ways. On the basis of these findings, in a second study we conducted an additional exploratory analysis of theoretically motivated brain regions in the language network. We demonstrated that data-driven computational models can be successfully integrated into theoretical frameworks to inform and test theories of semantic representation and processing. The findings from our work are discussed in light of future directions for neuroimaging and computational research."
Nicole EichertDavid PeetersPeter Hagoort,Behavior Research Methods,language driven anticipatory eye movements in virtual reality,2018,"Predictive language processing is often studied by measuring eye movements as participants look at objects on a computer screen while they listen to spoken sentences. This variant of the visual-world paradigm has revealed that information encountered by a listener at a spoken verb can give rise to anticipatory eye movements to a target object, which is taken to indicate that people predict upcoming words. The ecological validity of such findings remains questionable, however, because these computer experiments used two-dimensional stimuli that were mere abstractions of real-world objects. Here we present a visual-world paradigm study in a three-dimensional (3-D) immersive virtual reality environment. Despite significant changes in the stimulus materials and the different mode of stimulus presentation, language-mediated anticipatory eye movements were still observed. These findings thus indicate that people do predict upcoming words during language comprehension in a more naturalistic setting where natural depth cues are preserved. Moreover, the results confirm the feasibility of using eyetracking in rich and multimodal 3-D virtual environments."

Joseph P. MaglianoArthur C.

However, given the challenges of grading student-constructed responses, instructors may be hesitant to use them. There have been major advances in the application of natural language processing of student-constructed responses. This literature review focuses on two dimensions that need to be considered when developing new systems. The first is type of response provided by the student—namely, meaning-making responses (e.g., think-aloud protocols, tutorial dialogue) and products of comprehension (e.g., essays, open-ended questions). The second corresponds to considerations of the type of natural language processing systems used and how they are applied to analyze the student responses. We argue that the appropriateness of the assessment protocols is, in part, constrained by the type of response and researchers should use hybrid systems that rely on multiple, convergent natural language algorithms."

The adequacy of the model in reproducing the sample covariances is reflected by estimates of the parameters of the model and measures indicating the goodness of fit. Covariance structure analysis is frequently used for analyzing data obtained in nonexperimental or quasiexperimental research, but is seldom employed in experimental research. In this paper, the applicability of this technique in experimental research is discussed and illustrated by covariance structure analysis studies in which two models for word translation—the symmetrical model and the asymmetrical model—are described, refined, and contrasted."
Martin MarkoDrahomír MichalkoIgor Riečanský,Behavior Research Methods,remote associates test an empirical proof of concept,2018,"Associative processes play a major role in research on human thinking, especially creativity. One of the most influential models emphasizing associative processes in creative thinking was introduced by Mednick (Psychological Review, 69, 220–232, 1962), who developed the remote associates test (RAT) as a domain-general measure of individual differences in associative hierarchies. Although S. Mednick’s theoretical framework has recently regained much attention, the fundamental psychometric assumptions and underlying cognitive processes involved in the RAT remain controversial. We carried out two studies to evaluate these issues. In the first, a confirmatory factor analysis showed that a single latent factor accounted for the ability to solve RAT problems, despite their psycholinguistic heterogeneity. Subsequent regression analyses indicated that cue–solution associative remoteness substantially determined the difficulty of RAT problems, accounting for about 80% of variance. In the second study we used a newly developed associative chain test (ACT), which assesses lexical–semantic and executive measures during associative processing. We found that performance on the RAT was related to lexical–semantic (higher response remoteness and lower response commonness) but not to executive (response inhibition and switching) ACT measures. Overall, our findings indicate that the RAT reflects a coherent ability to access and combine remote elements in lexical–semantic and associative networks without considerably engaging executive attention. Although the validity and utility of the RAT was supported, we propose that the ACT provides a more complex and fine-grained tool for the assessment of associative processing."

The AMT is regarded as one of the most important assessment tools to study memory dysfunctions (e.g., difficulty recalling the specific details of memories) in psychopathology. In Study 1, we utilized the Japanese corpus data of 12,400 cue-recalled memories tagged with observer-rated specificity. We extracted linguistic features of particular relevance to memory specificity, such as past tense, negation, and adverbial words and phrases pertaining to time and location. On the basis of these features, a support vector machine (SVM) was trained to classify the memories into specific and nonspecific categories, which achieved an area under the curve (AUC) of .92 in a performance test. In Study 2, the trained SVM was tested in terms of its robustness in classifying novel memories (n = 8,478) that were retrieved in response to cue words that were different from those used in Study 1. The SVM showed an AUC of .89 in classifying the new memories. In Study 3, we extended the binary SVM to a five-class classification of the AMT, which achieved 64%–65% classification accuracy, against the chance level (20%) in the performance tests. Our data suggest that memory specificity can be identified with a relatively small number of words, capturing the universal linguistic features of memory specificity across memories in diverse contents."
Jean-Luc PerrinDamien PailléThierry Baccino,Behavior Research Methods,a new sentence generator providing material for maximum reading speed measurement,2015,"A new method is proposed to generate text material for assessing maximum reading speed of adult readers. The described procedure allows one to generate a vast number of equivalent short sentences. These sentences can be displayed for different durations in order to determine the reader’s maximum speed using a psychophysical threshold algorithm. Each sentence is built so that it is either true or false according to common knowledge. The actual reading is verified by asking the reader to determine the truth value of each sentence. We based our design on the generator described by Crossland et al. and upgraded it. The new generator handles concepts distributed in an ontology, which allows an easy determination of the sentences’ truth value and control of lexical and psycholinguistic parameters. In this way many equivalent sentence can be generated and displayed to perform the measurement. Maximum reading speed scores obtained with pseudo-randomly chosen sentences from the generator were strongly correlated with maximum reading speed scores obtained with traditional MNREAD sentences (r = .836). Furthermore, the large number of sentences that can be generated makes it possible to perform repeated measurements, since the possibility of a reader learning individual sentences is eliminated. Researchers interested in within-reader performance variability could use the proposed method for this purpose."

Two issues are discussed that researchers must attend to when evaluating the utility of LSA for predicting psychological phenomena. First, the role of semantic relatedness in the psychological process of interest must be understood. LSA indices of similarity should then be derived from this theoretical understanding. Second, the knowledge base (semantic space) from which similarity indices are generated must contain “knowledge” that is appropriate to the task at hand. Proposed solutions are illustrated with data from an experiment in which LSA-based indices were generated from theoretical analysis of the processes involved in understanding two conflicting accounts of a historical event. These indices predict the complexity of subsequent student reasoning about the event, as well as hand-coded predictions generated from think-aloud protocols collected when students were reading the accounts of the event."

The data of Experiment 1 indicated that the contact eye cover can be as effective as a rubber cup in restricting visual input. In Experiment 2, animals that were fitted binocularly with opaque eye covers performed as if blind on a task involving acquisition of pattern discrimination. In Experiment 3, binocular coverage with the opaque eye cover resulted in chance performance across 300 trials of a previously acquired pattern-discrimination habit. In Experiment 4, the base diameter of the eye cover was found to be a critical factor: Performance of a previously acquired brightness discrimination was reduced to chance levels by contact eye covers that approximated 7.0 mm in diameter. In Experiment 5, a smaller eye cover (6-mm diam) had no effect in limiting the visually evoked electrocortical response of the albino rat, while an eye cover of 7.2-mm diam produced a reliable attenuation of the response. The collective results indicate that appropriately fabricated contact eye covers are a viable means of restricting visual input and may justifiably be considered contact occluders."

To make the training more widely available, the Web-based trainer has been developed. Transforming the training from a human-delivered application to a computer-based one has resulted in a highly interactive trainer that adapts its methods to the performance of the students. The iSTART trainer introduces the strategies in a simulated classroom setting with interaction between three animated characters—an instructor character and two student characters— and the human trainee. Thereafter, the trainee identifies the strategies in the explanations of a student character who is guided by an instructor character. Finally, the trainee practices self-explanation under the guidance of an instructor character. We describe this system and discuss how appropriate feedback is generated."
Robert ThorstadPhillip Wolff,Behavior Research Methods,predicting future mental illness from social media a big data approach,2019,"In the present research, we investigated whether people’s everyday language contains sufficient signal to predict the future occurrence of mental illness. Language samples were collected from the social media website Reddit, drawing on posts to discussion groups focusing on different kinds of mental illness (clinical subreddits), as well as on posts to discussion groups focusing on nonmental health topics (nonclinical subreddits). As expected, words drawn from the clinical subreddits could be used to distinguish several kinds of mental illness (ADHD, anxiety, bipolar disorder, and depression). Interestingly, words drawn from the nonclinical subreddits (e.g., travel, cooking, cars) could also be used to distinguish different categories of mental illness, implying that the impact of mental illness spills over into topics unrelated to mental illness. Most importantly, words derived from the nonclinical subreddits predicted future postings to clinical subreddits, implying that everyday language contains signal about the likelihood of future mental illness, possibly before people are aware of their mental health condition. Finally, whereas models trained on clinical subreddits learned to focus on words indicating disorder-specific symptoms, models trained to predict future mental illness learned to focus on words indicating life stress, suggesting that kinds of features that are predictive of mental illness may change over time. Implications for the underlying causes of mental illness are discussed."

Three types of semantic benchmarks were compared: content words, exemplars, and strategies. Discriminant analyses were used to classify global and specific reading strategies using the LSA cosines. All benchmarks contributed to the classification of general reading strategies, but the exemplars did the best in distinguishing subtle semantic differences between reading strategies. Pragmatic and theoretical concerns of using LSA are discussed."

Associations to the cue “migrant” were collected from two independent and comprehensive samples in Hungary (N1 = 505, N2 = 505). The co-occurrence-based relations of the free word associations reflected emotional similarity, and the modules of the association network were validated with well-established measures. The positive pole of the associations was gathered around the concept of “Refugees” who need help, whereas the negative pole associated asylum seekers with “Violence.” The results were relatively consistent in the two independent samples.

BRCA Gist appears to be the first ITS designed to assist patients’ health decision making. Two studies provide fine-grained analyses of the verbal interactions between BRCA Gist and women responding to five questions pertaining to breast cancer and genetic risk. We examined how “gist explanations” generated by participants during natural-language dialogues related to outcomes. Using reliable rubrics, scripts of the participants’ verbal interactions with BRCA Gist were rated for content and for the appropriateness of the tutor’s responses. Human researchers’ scores for the content covered by the participants were strongly correlated with the coverage scores generated by BRCA Gist, indicating that BRCA Gist accurately assesses the extent to which people respond appropriately. In Study 1, participants’ performance during the dialogues was consistently associated with learning outcomes about breast cancer risk. Study 2 was a field study with a more diverse population. Participants with an undergraduate degree or less education who were randomly assigned to BRCA Gist scored higher on tests of knowledge than those assigned to the National Cancer Institute website or than a control group. We replicated findings that the more expected content that participants included in their gist explanations, the better they performed on outcome measures. As fuzzy-trace theory suggests, encouraging people to develop and elaborate upon gist explanations appears to improve learning, comprehension, and decision making."

Eye-tracking technology potentially allows for much more precise measurement of how attention is allocated at the subsecond scale, but a number of technical and methodological issues have given rise to caution about the quality and reliability of high temporal resolution data obtained from infants. We present analyses suggesting that when standard dispersal-based fixation detection algorithms are used to parse eye-tracking data obtained from infants, the results appear to be heavily influenced by interindividual variations in data quality. We discuss the causes of these artifacts, including fragmentary fixations arising from flickery or unreliable contact with the eyetracker and variable degrees of imprecision in reported position of gaze. We also present new algorithms designed to cope with these problems by including a number of new post hoc verification checks to identify and eliminate fixations that may be artifactual. We assess the results of our algorithms by testing their reliability using a variety of methods and on several data sets. We contend that, with appropriate data analysis methods, fixation duration can be a reliable and stable measure in infants. We conclude by discussing ways in which studying fixation durations during unconstrained orienting may offer insights into the relationship between attention and learning in naturalistic settings."

Despite this, and despite advances in the efficiency, affordability, and sophistication of vocal analytic technologies, there is considerable variability across studies regarding what aspects of vocal expression are studied. Vocal signals can be quantified in a myriad of ways, and their underlying structure, at least with respect to “macroscopic” measures from extended speech, is presently unclear. To address this issue, we evaluated the psychometric properties—notably, the structural and construct validity—of a systematically defined set of global vocal features. Our analytic strategy focused on (a) identifying redundant variables among this set, (b) employing principal components analysis (PCA) to identify nonoverlapping domains of vocal expression, (c) examining the degrees to which the vocal variables are modulated as a function of changes in speech task, and (d) evaluating the relationship between the vocal variables and cognitive (i.e., verbal fluency) and clinical (i.e., depression, anxiety, and hostility) variables. Spontaneous speech samples from 11 independent studies of young adults (>60 s in length), employing one of three different speaking tasks, were examined (N = 1,350). Confounding variables (i.e., sex, ethnicity) were statistically controlled for. The PCA identified six distinct domains of vocal expression. Collectively, vocal expression (defined in terms of these domains) was modulated as a function of speech task and was related to the cognitive and clinical variables. These findings provide empirically grounded implications for the study of vocal expression in psychological and clinical sciences."

The approach offers a way to capture motion adapted from the film industry in which markers placed on the skin of the face can be tracked with a pattern-matching algorithm. The method records and postprocesses raw facial movement data (coordinates per frame) of distinctly placed markers and is intended for use in facial expression research (e.g., microexpressions) in laboratory settings. Due to the explicit use of specifically placed, artificial markers, the procedure offers the simultaneous measurement of several emotionally relevant markers in a (psychometrically) objective and artifact-free way, even for facial regions without natural landmarks (e.g., the cheeks). In addition, the proposed procedure is fully based on open-source software and is transparent at every step of data processing. Two worked examples demonstrate the practicability of the proposed procedure: In Study 1(N= 39), the participants were instructed to show the emotions happiness, sadness, disgust, and anger, and in Study 2 (N= 113), they were asked to present both a neutral face and the emotions happiness, disgust, and fear. Study 2 involved the simultaneous tracking of 14 markers for approximately 12 min per participant with a time resolution of 33 ms. The measured facial movements corresponded closely to the assumptions of established measurement instruments (EMFACS, FACSAID, Friesen & Ekman, 1983; Ekman & Hager, 2002).

Mean activity in the lesioned baboon was 41% less than that of the nonlesioned baboon measured over a 14-day period. In addition, the daily maximum activity value was significantly less in the MPTP-treated baboon. Moreover, resting and sleeping periods were 30% greater in the lesioned animal. The akinesia and resting and sleeping periods were displayed by the lesioned baboon throughout the day, whereas the control baboon showed them only at night. The data representing summarized movement activity are in accordance with observations of bradykinesia, hypokinesia, and akinesia of the MPTP-treated baboon. The actigraph was well tolerated by the animal because its small size and weight made it largely unobtrusive. We suggest that the actigraph is an appropriate device for measuring motor activity in nonhuman primates."

First we give a general overview of the HyperCard program; after that, we present two HyperCard stacks as sample solutions for two specific research applications. Surveyor, a self-contained survey tool, is a HyperCard-based vehicle for developing, administering, and processing tests and surveys. Queston demonstrates how HyperCard can be used as a data-management and data-analysis tool during the stages of questionnaire development. Both stacks illustrate how flexible HyperCard is and how easy it is to use it to manage, analyze, and process data, to transfer data to other programs, and to print reports. HyperCard, unlike traditional applications, gives the user a great degree of control over the way information is stored, mainipulated, and presented. Although both stacks are custom-made for specific purposes, the concepts underlying the design can be generally applied and adapted for other purposes."

Thirty-one children between the ages of 4 and 7 years were videotaped while watching short video clips designed to elicit happiness or fear. Embedded in the audio track of the video clips were acoustic startle probes. A coding system was developed to quantify from the video record the strength of the eye-blink startle response to the probes. EMG measurement of the eye blink was obtained simultaneously. Intercoder reliability for the video coding was high (Cohen’sκ = .90). The average within-subjects probe-by-probe correlation between the EMG- and video-based methods was .84. Group-level correlations between the methods were also strong, and there was some evidence of emotion modulation of the startle response with both the EMG- and the video-derived data. Although the video method cannot be used to assess the latency, probability, or duration of startle blinks, the findings indicate that it can serve as a valid proxy of EMG in the assessment of the magnitude of emotion-modulated startle in studies of children conducted outside of a laboratory setting, where traditional psychophysiological methods are not feasible."
Ian Morrison,Behavior Research Methods & Instrumentation,compact representations of positional knowledge in short and long words for letters and features,1983,"Single-letter statistical measures providing values for each letter-position and word-length combination are too unwieldy for use in working letter-recognition models; more compact tables are needed. Compact tables collapsing word length to short or long words and letter positions to first, last, or middle letters are presented for the frequency and versatility of single letters. Letter-position and word-size differences are preserved in this reduced format. To test awareness of these values, subjects rate the commonness of letters in each letter position. Their responses indicate high intersubject agreement and correlate highly with the frequency and versatility measures. A LISP program that translates the letter knowledge for each letter into a corresponding knowledge for each feature in a feature set is described. Distinctiveness values for each feature (see Shimron & Navon, 1981) are computed."

As an illustration of how to use the Chemnitz LogAnalyzer, we give an account of one study on learning with hypertext. Participants either searched for specific details or read a hypertext document to familiarize themselves with its content. The tool helped identify navigation strategies affected by these two processing goals and provided comparisons, for example, of processing times and visited sites. Altogether, the Chemnitz LogAnalyzer fills the gap between log files as raw data of Web-based studies and conventional statistical software."

Such variation can come from either random intra-and intersubject variability or from the effects of independent variables that are manipulated between conditions. The effect of such variability is investigated by simulation of these latency-varying events and by analysis of evoked responses in a behavioral task, the Sternberg memory search task, which is well known to generate variation in the latency of brain events. The results of PCA of within-subjects differences in these two situations are plausibly related to underlying stages of information processing, and the technique may augment reaction time data by providing information on the time of occurrence as well as the duration of stages of information processing."

Procedures for deriving the LRP on the basis of event-related brain potential (ERP) waveforms obtained over the left and right motor cortices are described, and some findings are summarized that show that the LRP is likely to reflect activation processes within the motor cortex. Two experiments investigating spatial S-R compatibility effects are reported that demonstrate that, because of systematic overlaps of motor and nonmotor asymmetries, LRP waveforms derived by the double subtraction method cannot always be interpreted unequivocally in terms of response activation. Such confounds can be detected when LRP waveforms are compared with difference waveforms obtained by the double subtraction method from ERPs elicited at other lateral scalp sites."

Nevertheless, there is no consensus regarding how characters should be segmented into logographemes and radicals. This article reports handwriting data for a list of 209 Chinese characters (95 nonphonetic compounds and 114 phonetic compounds) in a copying task. To validate the constituent logographemes and radicals of the target Chinese characters, comparisons among between-radical interstroke intervals (ISIs), between-logographeme ISIs, and within-logographeme ISIs, as well as their interactions with orthographic factors including character frequency, stroke number, and configuration, were conducted using factorial analyses. The results showed that the ISI comparison method is effective in validating the constituent logographemes and radicals in Chinese characters. On the basis of this list of 209 stimuli, another 1,227 Chinese characters that share the same set of radicals with the stimuli were further identified. Their constituent logographemes were deduced accordingly. Altogether, the over 1,000 Chinese characters with validated constituent logographemes will serve as a powerful reference for future psycholinguistic and neurolinguistic research. Future potential applications are discussed."

MuÑozDanielle Mcnamara,"Behavior Research Methods, Instruments, & Computers",using latent semantic analysis to assess reader strategies,2002,"We tested a computer-based procedure for assessing reader strategies that was based on verbal protocols that utilized latent semantic analysis (LSA). Students were given self-explanation—reading training (SERT), which teaches strategies that facilitate self-explanation during reading, such as elaboration based on world knowledge and bridging between text sentences. During a computerized version of SERT practice, students read texts and typed self-explanations into a computer after each sentence. The use of SERT strategies during this practice was assessed by determining the extent to which students used the information in the current sentence versus the prior text or world knowledge in their self-explanations. This assessment was made on the basis of human judgments and LSA. Both human judgments and LSA were remarkably similar and indicated that students who were not complying with SERT tended to paraphrase the text sentences, whereas students who were compliant with SERT tended to explain the sentences in terms of what they knew about the world and of information provided in the prior text context. The similarity between human judgments and LSA indicates that LSA will be useful in accounting for reading strategies in a Web-based version of SERT."

This study exemplarily used sentence reading as a stand-in for paradigms that assess pupil size in tasks during which changes in gaze position are unavoidable. The influence of gaze position on pupil size was first investigated by an artificial eye model with a fixed pupil size. Despite its fixed pupil size, the systematic measurements of the artificial eye model revealed substantial gaze-position-dependent changes in the measured pupil size. We evaluated two functions and showed that they can accurately capture and correct the gaze-dependent measurement error of pupil size recorded during a sentence-reading and an effortless z-string-scanning task. Implications for previous studies are discussed, and recommendations for future studies are provided."

This anatomical design allows for the relatively selective activation of one cerebral hemisphere under monocular viewing conditions. Here, we describe the design of a harness and face mask allowing simple and noninvasive monocular occlusion in rats. The harness is constructed from synthetic fiber (shoelace-type material) and fits around the girth region and neck, allowing for easy adjustments to fit rats of various weights. The face mask consists of soft rubber material that is attached to the harness by Velcro strips. Eyeholes in the mask can be covered by additional Velcro patches to occlude either one or both eyes. Rats readily adapt to wearing the device, allowing behavioral testing under different types of viewing conditions. We show that rats successfully acquire a water-maze-based visual discrimination task under monocular viewing conditions. Following task acquisition, interocular transfer was assessed. Performance with the previously occluded, “untrained” eye was impaired, suggesting that training effects were partially confined to one cerebral hemisphere. The method described herein provides a simple and noninvasive means to restrict visual input for studies of visual processing and learning in various rodent species."

It also enables field studies of reading behavior in the classroom and other learning environments. We present a study of the data quality provided by two remote eye trackers, one being a low-sampling-rate, low-cost system. Then we present two algorithms for mapping fixations derived from the data to the words being read. One is for immediate (or real-time) mapping of fixations to words and the other for deferred (or post hoc) mapping. Following this, an evaluation study is reported. Both studies were carried out in the classroom of a Finnish elementary school with students who were second graders. This study shows very high success rates in automatically mapping fixations to the lines of text being read when the mapping is deferred. The success rates for immediate mapping are comparable with those obtained in earlier studies, although here the data is collected some 10 min after initial calibration of low-sample (30 Hz) remote eye trackers, rather than a laboratory setting using high-sampling-rate trackers. The results provide a solid basis for developing systems for use in classrooms and other learning environments that can provide immediate automatic support with reading, and share data between a group of learners and the teacher of that group. This makes possible new approaches to the learning of reading and comprehension skills."

Interest is growing in this type of stimulus for research in neuroscience. This interest stems from the advantage of separating the component of pure human action kinematics from other pictorial information, such as facial expression and muscle contraction. Although several groups have previously developed datasets of human point-light actions, due to the lack of datasets composed of daily actions with short durations, we developed 20 biological and 40 control (scrambled) point-light movements by using the technique of recording people wearing reflector patches. The videos are about 1 s long. Subsequently, we performed a judgment task in which 100 participants (50 male and 50 female) evaluated each video according to three categories: human action resemblance, performed action, and gender of actor. We present the mean scores of each evaluation for each video, and further propose a selection of the most suitable videos to be used as human point-light action displays and scrambled point-light displays for control. Finally, we discuss our findings on the gender attributions of the point-light displays."
Hannes MatuschekReinhold Kliegl,Behavior Research Methods,on the ambiguity of interaction and nonlinear main effects in a regime of dependent covariates,2018,"The analysis of large experimental datasets frequently reveals significant interactions that are difficult to interpret within the theoretical framework guiding the research. Some of these interactions actually arise from the presence of unspecified nonlinear main effects and statistically dependent covariates in the statistical model. Importantly, such nonlinear main effects may be compatible (or, at least, not incompatible) with the current theoretical framework. In the present literature, this issue has only been studied in terms of correlated (linearly dependent) covariates. Here we generalize to nonlinear main effects (i.e., main effects of arbitrary shape) and dependent covariates. We propose a novel nonparametric method to test for ambiguous interactions where present parametric methods fail. We illustrate the method with a set of simulations and with reanalyses (a) of effects of parental education on their children’s educational expectations and (b) of effects of word properties on fixation locations during reading of natural sentences, specifically of effects of length and morphological complexity of the word to be fixated next. The resolution of such ambiguities facilitates theoretical progress."

Hedda LausbergHan Sloetjes,Behavior Research Methods,the revised neurogeselan system an objective and reliable interdisciplinary analysis tool for nonverbal behavior and gesture,2016,"As visual media spread to all domains of public and scientific life, nonverbal behavior is taking its place as an important form of communication alongside the written and spoken word. An objective and reliable method of analysis for hand movement behavior and gesture is therefore currently required in various scientific disciplines, including psychology, medicine, linguistics, anthropology, sociology, and computer science. However, no adequate common methodological standards have been developed thus far. Many behavioral gesture-coding systems lack objectivity and reliability, and automated methods that register specific movement parameters often fail to show validity with regard to psychological and social functions. To address these deficits, we have combined two methods, an elaborated behavioral coding system and an annotation tool for video and audio data. The NEUROGES–ELAN system is an effective and user-friendly research tool for the analysis of hand movement behavior, including gesture, self-touch, shifts, and actions. Since its first publication in 2009 in Behavior Research Methods, the tool has been used in interdisciplinary research projects to analyze a total of 467 individuals from different cultures, including subjects with mental disease and brain damage. Partly on the basis of new insights from these studies, the system has been revised methodologically and conceptually. The article presents the revised version of the system, including a detailed study of reliability. The improved reproducibility of the revised version makes NEUROGES–ELAN a suitable system for basic empirical research into the relation between hand movement behavior and gesture and cognitive, emotional, and interactive processes and for the development of automated movement behavior recognition methods."

The capacity coefficient is a function across time that provides a useful measure of this construct. Until now, most analyses of the capacity coefficient have focused on the magnitude of this function, and often only in terms of a qualitative comparison (greater than or less than one). This work explains how a functional extension of principal components analysis can capture the time-extended information of these functional data, using a small number of scalar values chosen to emphasize the variance between participants and conditions. This approach provides many possibilities for a more fine-grained study of differences in workload capacity across tasks and individuals."
Dirk P.

The classical analysis of variance does not apply; alternatives have been proposed but have failed to catch on, and a statistically unsatisfactory procedure of using two approximations (known as F 1 and F 2) has become the standard. A simple and elegant solution using mixed model analysis has been available for 15 years, and recent improvements in statistical software have made mixed models analysis widely available. The aim of this article is to increase the use of mixed models by giving a concise practical introduction and by giving clear directions for undertaking the analysis in the most popular statistical packages. The article also introduces the djmixed add-on package for SPSS, which makes entering the models and reporting their results as straightforward as possible."
Juan HaroMarc GuaschBlanca VallèsPilar Ferré,Behavior Research Methods,is pupillary response a reliable index of word recognition evidence from a delayed lexical decision task,2017,"Previous word recognition studies have shown that the pupillary response is sensitive to a word’s frequency. However, such a pupillary effect may be due to the process of executing a response, instead of being an index of word processing. With the aim of exploring this possibility, we recorded the pupillary responses in two experiments involving a lexical decision task (LDT). In the first experiment, participants completed a standard LDT, whereas in the second they performed a delayed LDT. The delay in the response allowed us to compare pupil dilations with and without the response execution component. The results showed that pupillary response was modulated by word frequency in both the standard and the delayed LDT. This finding supports the reliability of using pupillometry for word recognition research. Importantly, our results also suggest that tasks that do not require a response during pupil recording lead to clearer and stronger effects."
Margaret WardleKatherine CederbaumHarriet de Wit,Behavior Research Methods,quantifying talk developing reliable measures of verbal productivity,2011,"Measuring talkativeness is of interest to several areas of research. However, there are few brief, validated measures available. We examined test-retest reliability, inter-relationships and convergent/divergent validity for five brief measures of verbal productivity. Nineteen men and 32 women participated in four sessions, completing five speech tasks that varied in demand, purpose of speech and sociability. Several potential metrics (word count, duration and rate) were examined. All tasks except a novel Unprompted Speech task demonstrated good word count test-retest reliability (interclass correlation coefficients from .71 to .85). Factor analysis revealed low-demand, non-functional tasks formed one factor (“Voluntary Talkativeness”), while higher demand tasks formed a second factor (“Speech Ability”). This finding and examination of relationships with IQ, personality and gender indicate “Voluntary Talkativeness” is not wholly accounted for by verbal ability, and is only weakly related to self-reported personality. Recommendations for the measurement of “Voluntary Talkativeness” are made."
Jon Sprouse,Behavior Research Methods,a validation of amazon mechanical turk for the collection of acceptability judgments in linguistic theory,2011,"Amazon’s Mechanical Turk (AMT) is a Web application that provides instant access to thousands of potential participants for survey-based psychology experiments, such as the acceptability judgment task used extensively in syntactic theory. Because AMT is a Web-based system, syntacticians may worry that the move out of the experimenter-controlled environment of the laboratory and onto the user-controlled environment of AMT could adversely affect the quality of the judgment data collected. This article reports a quantitative comparison of two identical acceptability judgment experiments, each with 176 participants (352 total): one conducted in the laboratory, and one conducted on AMT. Crucial indicators of data quality—such as participant rejection rates, statistical power, and the shape of the distributions of the judgments for each sentence type—are compared between the two samples. The results suggest that aside from slightly higher participant rejection rates, AMT data are almost indistinguishable from laboratory data."
J. Gotman,Behavior Research Methods & Instrumentation,a computer system to assist in the evaluation of the eegs of epileptic patients,1981,"The specific EEG manifestations of epilepsy, seizures, and interictal spikes and sharp waves occur at unpredictable times and at variable frequencies. To obtain an adequate diagnosis, it is often necessary to record the EEG for several hours or several days. A computer system was developed to perform data reduction and quantification by continuously monitoring seizures and automatically recognizing interictal spikes and sharp waves. The past 2 min of EEG are kept on the computer disk at every instant. When an epileptic seizure occurs or when a spike is detected, a sample of EEG, including a section preceding the event itself, is written on the EEG polygraph and on magnetic tape. A continuous recording is thus replaced by samples of varying lengths, containing only the important aspects of the EEG, reducing considerably the original data. After the monitoring session, the spatial and temporal distributions of the interictal activity are presented in a quantified form on the terminal. The seizures are recorded on digital tape and are available for several types of processing. The patient is also monitored by a video system; EEG and video are synchronized by a time-of-day clock to allow electroclinical correlations."

Separate control groups received either (a) no CS or US, (b) CS-alone, or (c) completely random presentations of CS and US. Few CRs occurred in the experimental group at the outset of conditioning, but the percentage of CRs during the second half of the first acquisition session exceeded 95%. Conditioning stabilized above 95% CRs during Acquisition Sessions 3 through 7. These responses could not be attributed to pseudoconditioning, sensitization, or other nonassociative factors. When the experimental group was subsequently given six CS-alone sessions, the course of extinction was gradual. Most results seemed similar to those previously obtained during classical conditioning of the nictitating membrane in rabbits."
Ronald H. OlchStanley E. Hecht,Behavior Research Methods & Instrumentation,microcomputer graphics in psychological research,1979,"This paper discusses a methodology for psychological instrumentation in which requirements common to a spectrum of experiments are defined and implemented in a microcomputer system. The microcomputer may either stand alone or be used as an intelligent front end to a larger computer. In either case, experiments are described in a high-level implementation language. The advantages of this approach include reduced hardware and maintenance costs, increased reliability, and smoother operation by research personnel. A tutorial example is given of the design and construction of one such system used to present visual stimuli, including text, graphics, and simple animation, on a movable array of video monitors. Displays are produced by a Z80 microcomputer in response to commands from a larger host computer, in this case a PDP Lab/8e. Illustrations are given of three studies in progress; comparisons are made with special-purpose equipment built earlier. The microcomputer system is preferable from both a cost and management point of view."

Abhilasha A. KumarSudheendra HangalAllyson C. Rosen,Behavior Research Methods,autobiographical recall of personally familiar names and temporal information in e mails an automatic analytic approach using e mail communications,2019,"An important question that arises from autobiographical memory research is whether the variables that influence memory in the laboratory also drive memory for autobiographical episodes in real life. We explored this question within the context of e-mail communications and investigated the variables that influence recall for personally familiar names and temporal information in e-mails. We designed a Web-based program that analyzed each participant’s year-old sent e-mail archive and applied textual analysis algorithms to identify a set of sentences likely to be memorable. These sentences were then used as the stimuli in a cued recall task. Participants saw two sentences from their sent e-mail as a cue and attempted to recall the name of the e-mail recipient. Participants also rated the vividness of recall for the e-mail conversation and estimated the month in which they had written the e-mail. Linear mixed-effect analyses revealed that recipient name recall accuracy decreased with longer retention intervals and increased with greater frequency of contact with the recipient. Also, with longer retention intervals, participants dated e-mails as being more recent than their actual month. This telescoping error was moderately larger for e-mails with greater sentiment. These findings suggest that memory for personally familiar names and temporal information in e-mails closely follows the patterns for autobiographical memory and proper-name recall found in laboratory settings. This study introduces an innovative, Web-based experimental method for studying the cognitive processes related to autobiographical memories using ecologically valid, naturalistic communications."

Glueck,Behavior Research Methods & Instrumentation,a user interactive graphics based computer system for analysis of the eeg,1981,"Computer technology provides a powerful high-resolution tool for the analysis and understanding of the electroencephalogram (EEG). A system of user-interactive graphics-based computer programs analyzing the power spectral density (PSD), coherence, and phase-angle relationships of the EEG is described, along with the mathematical algorithms used. The analytic variables inherent in coherence analysis are reviewed. These variables include choices of sampling parameters, auto- and cross-spectral algorithms, smoothing techniques, and use of the γ2(f) or γ(f) value for coherence. These variables in the analysis itself have a net interactive effect on the calculated results that often makes comparability of data across studies impossible. Thus, it is proposed that studies include a graph showing the authors’ derived coherence values for a set of standard test signals to enhance scientific communication."

Methods were developed to calculate eye velocity and eye acceleration in real-time from an electronystag-mogram (ENG) signal that was recorded using a one-pole RC high-pass filter in the preamplifier. Nonrecursive, finite impulse-response digital filters were designed to remove the effects of the RC high-pass filter and calculate the first and second time derivatives of the ENG signal, as well as remove high-frequency noise. Applying these new techniques to the analysis of vestibular nystagmus enables estimation of the transfer characteristics of the vestibuloocular system."

Dalrymple-Alford,Behavior Research Methods,performance in normal subjects on a novel battery of driving related sensory motor and cognitive tests,2009,"Currently, there is no international standard for the assessment of fitness to drive for cognitively or physically impaired persons. A computerized battery of driving-related sensory-motor and cognitive tests (SMCTests) has been developed, comprising tests of visuoperception, visuomotor ability, complex attention, visual search, decision making, impulse control, planning, and divided attention. Construct validity analysis was conducted in 60 normal, healthy subjects and showed that, overall, the novel cognitive tests assessed cognitive functions similar to a set of standard neuropsychological tests. The novel tests were found to have greater perceived face validity for predicting on-road driving ability than was found in the equivalent standard tests. Test—retest stability and reliability of SMCTests measures, as well as correlations between SMCTests and on-road driving, were determined in a subset of 12 subjects. The majority of test measures were stable and reliable across two sessions, and significant correlations were found between on-road driving scores and measures from ballistic movement, footbrake reaction, hand-control reaction, and complex attention. The substantial face validity, construct validity, stability, and reliability of SMCTests, together with the battery’s level of correlation with on-road driving in normal subjects, strengthen our confidence in the ability of SMCTests to detect and identify sensory-motor and cognitive deficits related to unsafe driving and increased risk of accidents."

Mundt,Behavior Research Methods,standardization of pitch range settings in voice acoustic analysis,2009,"Voice acoustic analysis is typically a labor-intensive, time-consuming process that requires the application of idiosyncratic parameters tailored to individual aspects of the speech signal. Such processes limit the efficiency and utility of voice analysis in clinical practice as well as in applied research and development. In the present study, we analyzed 1,120 voice files, using standard techniques (case-by-case hand analysis), taking roughly 10 work weeks of personnel time to complete. The results were compared with the analytic output of several automated analysis scripts that made use of preset pitch-range parameters. After pitch windows were selected to appropriately account for sex differences, the automated analysis scripts reduced processing time of the 1,120 speech samples to less than 2.5 h and produced results comparable to those obtained with hand analysis. However, caution should be exercised when applying the suggested preset values to pathological voice populations."

The cigarette holder contains both smoke-mixing and flow-measurement orifices and a smoke-concentration sensor. Smoke flow through the holder and smoke concentration in the holder are determined simultaneously. The two signals are multiplied electronically and the product signal integrated. The integrated response is directly proportional to the amount of particulate matter collected immediately downstream of the holder, regardless of cigarette type or the particular way in which the cigarette is smoked. The CSM is sufficiently sensitive to quantitatively determine the amount of smoke TPM generated from cigarettes in the 1-mg Federal Trade Commission tar-delivery category."

Subjects are asked to create a full soundscape by means of a dedicated software tool, coupled with a structured sound data set. This paradigm is used to characterize urban sound environment representations by analyzing the sound classes that were used to simulate the auditory scenes. A rating experiment of the soundscape pleasantness using a seven-point bipolar semantic scale is conducted to further refine the analysis of the simulated urban acoustic scenes. Results show that (1) a semantic characterization in terms of presence/absence of sound sources is an effective way to characterize urban soundscape pleasantness, and (2) acoustic pressure levels computed for specific sound sources better characterize the appraisal than the acoustic pressure level computed over the overall soundscape."
Christopher R. WolfeAimin WangDoris Bergen,"Behavior Research Methods, Instruments, & Computers",assessing the winning teams program of interactive satellite based training,1999,"This research assessed an interactive satellite-based training program integrating interactive audiovisual experiences with face-to-face interactions. Key elements were content created by experts, high-quality video segments, satellite-based interaction, off-line interactions among teams of parents and caregivers, workshops, and team building exercises. For pragmatic reasons, it was necessary to develop brief assessment instruments concurrently with training. A large set of survey items were created from draft materials and reduced empirically through piloting to those with the best psychometric properties. To avoid the appearance of traditional testing, knowledge was assessed with Likert items. Surveys measured participant satisfaction, knowledge, attitudes, and the application and articulation of concepts. Participant satisfaction was high. Participants increased positive attitudes and learned appropriate vocabulary. Training was more effective than no training or watching videotapes. The program appears to represent a viable model of training that could successfully be applied to Internet technologies."

Presented are the SLOT communication task and the software and hardware that has been developed to run SLOT experiments and record the participants’ multimodal behavior. SLOT offers a high level of flexibility in varying the context of the communication and is particularly useful in studies of the relationship between pen gestures and speech. We illustrate the use of the SLOT platform by discussing the results of some early experiments. The first is an experiment on negotiation with a one-way mirror between the participants, and the second is an exploratory study of automatic recognition of spontaneous pen gestures. The results of these studies demonstrate the usefulness of the SLOT platform for conducting multimodal communication research in both human-human and human-computer interactions."
Lena SteindorfJan Rummel,Behavior Research Methods,do your eyes give you away a validation study of eye movement measures used as indicators for mindless reading,2019,"Identifying eye-movement measures as objective indicators of mind wandering seems to be a work in progress. We reviewed research comparing eye movements during self-categorized episodes of normal versus mindless reading and found little consensus regarding the specific measures that are sensitive to attentional decoupling during mind wandering. To address this issue of inconsistency, we conducted a new, high-powered eye-tracking experiment and considered all previously identified mind-wandering indicators. In our experiment, only three measures (reading time, fixation count, and first-fixation duration) positively predicted self-categorized mindless reading. Aside from these single measures, the word-frequency effect was found to be generally less pronounced during mindless-reading than during normal-reading episodes. To additionally test for convergent validity between the objective and subjective mind-wandering measures, we utilized eye-movement measures as well as thought reports, to examine the effect of metacognitive awareness on mind-wandering behavior. We expected that participants anticipating a difficult comprehension test would mind wander less during reading than would those anticipating an easy test. Although we were able to induce metacognitive expectancies about task difficulty, we found no evidence that these difficulty expectancies affected either subjectively reported or objectively measured mind wandering."
Yao-Ting SungJu-Ling ChenJi-Her ChaHou-Chiang TsengTao-Hsing ChangKuo-En Chang,Behavior Research Methods,constructing and validating readability models the method of integrating multilevel linguistic features with machine learning,2015,"Multilevel linguistic features have been proposed for discourse analysis, but there have been few applications of multilevel linguistic features to readability models and also few validations of such models. Most traditional readability formulae are based on generalized linear models (GLMs; e.g., discriminant analysis and multiple regression), but these models have to comply with certain statistical assumptions about data properties and include all of the data in formulae construction without pruning the outliers in advance. The use of such readability formulae tends to produce a low text classification accuracy, while using a support vector machine (SVM) in machine learning can enhance the classification outcome. The present study constructed readability models by integrating multilevel linguistic features with SVM, which is more appropriate for text classification. Taking the Chinese language as an example, this study developed 31 linguistic features as the predicting variables at the word, semantic, syntax, and cohesion levels, with grade levels of texts as the criterion variable. The study compared four types of readability models by integrating unilevel and multilevel linguistic features with GLMs and an SVM. The results indicate that adopting a multilevel approach in readability analysis provides a better representation of the complexities of both texts and the reading comprehension process."
David J. LobinaJosep DemestreJosé E. García-Albea,Behavior Research Methods,disentangling perceptual and psycholinguistic factors in syntactic processing tone monitoring via erps,2018,"Franco, Gaillard, Cleeremans, and Destrebecqz (Behavior Research Methods, 47, 1393–1403, 2015), in a study on statistical learning employing the click-detection paradigm, conclude that more needs to be known about how this paradigm interacts with statistical learning and speech perception. Past results with this monitoring technique have pointed to an end-of-clause effect in parsing—a structural effect—but we here show that the issues are a bit more nuanced. Firstly, we report two Experiments (1a and 1b), which show that reaction times (RTs) are affected by two factors: (a) processing load, resulting in a tendency for RTs to decrease across a sentence, and (b) a perceptual effect which adds to this tendency and moreover helps neutralize differences between sentences with slightly different structures. These two factors are then successfully discriminated by registering event-related brain potentials (ERPs) during a monitoring task, with Experiment 2 establishing that the amplitudes of the N1 and P3 components—the first associated with temporal uncertainty, the second with processing load in dual tasks—correlate with RTs. Finally, Experiment 3 behaviorally segregates the two factors by placing the last tone at the end of sentences, activating a wrap-up operation and thereby both disrupting the decreasing tendency and highlighting structural effects. Our overall results suggest that much care needs to be employed in designing click-detection tasks if structural effects are sought, and some of the now-classic data need to be reconsidered."

Text classification tasks, like Text Categorization, help the users to access to the great amount of text they find in the Internet and their organizations. TC is the classification of documents into a predefined set of categories. Most approaches to automatic TC are based on the utilization of a training collection, which is a set of manually classified documents.

This article describes an approach to TC based on the integration of a training collection (Reuters-21578) and a lexical database (WordNet 1.6) as knowledge sources. Lexical databases accumulate information on the lexical items of one or several languages. This information must be filtered in order to make an effective use of it in our model of TC.
